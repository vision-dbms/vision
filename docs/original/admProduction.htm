<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>
Many Vision installations expect to receive various data feeds on a 
regular basis.  Once the data is saved in the Vision database, other
updates that rely on this data can be performed.  In addition,
standard production reports can be generated based on the completion
of one or more updates.
<p>
It is useful to automate the production cycle so that standard
updates and report generations can be scheduled to run each night.
There are a number of ways that you can automate your daily
production cycle.  A comprehensive set of scripts has been 
provided for Unix environments as a template for this automation.
These tools enable you to:  
<ul type=disc>
<li>Define any number of update and report jobs that can be scheduled to run 
on a daily or as needed basis.<p>
<li>Assign dependencies to jobs so that specific tasks will not begin
until other tasks have completed.<p>  
<li>Get a quick snapshot of the status of the current production cycle.
</ul>
<p>
These scripts can be used directly or can serve as a basis for
designing your own production processing.  With the exception of
the last section, the remainder of this 
document refers to the production management tools included with
Unix installations.  <a href="#custom">The last section</a>
describes the building blocks you will need if you design your
own production processing.

<h3 id="process">Overview of the Production Process</h3>
<p>

A <b>job</b> can be thought of as any task that needs to be executed.  For
example, an update job could update security prices using a file
supplied by an external vendor.  A report job could display a list of
any security with a price change of more than ten percent.  Any job
can be dependent on one or more conditions being met.  For example,
the security price update job requires that the external file of
prices is available.  A portfolio holdings update job requires that
the security and portfolio master updates for the day have completed
successfully.  The price change report job requires that the
security price update job has completed.  The rules
for defining dependency conditions are stored in files known as
<b>okay scripts</b>.
<p>
You can create a <b>job</b> and an optional <b>okay script</b>
for any updates and reports that you want to run on a regular 
or as-needed basis.  In addition, tools are provided to submit 
any ad-hoc updates of Vision code and data feeds that you want to 
commit to the database.
<p>
The production processing is managed by various file <b>tokens</b>, files
whose existence control or reflect specific processing events.  For
example, you could manually create a token to schedule a job or to
indicate that a data file is ready for processing.  The production
cycle creates tokens to indicate that specific jobs have been
completed or canceled.  Token files are used extensively during the
production cycle.  
<p>
Each night, <b>cron</b> starts a process known as the <b>daily.daemon</b>.
This daemon performs any general maintenance activities required and
starts the scripts that manage the update and reporting queues.  The
nightly daemon runs until it is terminated or until the next night's
daemon begins.  The daemon can be scheduled to run on business nights
only (i.e., Monday through Friday) or on any other schedule that
suits your organization's needs.  
<p>

<p><hr>
<h3 id="install">Installation</h3>
<p>
The Vision Server Installation for Unix servers
includes a comprehensive set of scripts that can be used to
automate your daily production cycle.  No special installation or
modifications are needed to use these tools.  
<p>
If you are currently using the <a href="#vadmin"><i>VAdmin</i> Module</a>
to submit data feeds and Vision script updates, you should modify the
<i>.cshrc</i>
and the <i>.login</i> files for the Vision Administrator user code
(e.g., <i>dbadmin</i>) to include
the following:<ul><pre>#---  in .cshrc
source /localvision/include/dba.cshrc.inc

#---  in .login
source /localvision/include/dba.login.inc</pre></ul>
This will set a number of environment variables, including 
some that are used by the <i>VAdmin</i> Module, to control
updates in a production environment.
<p>
You will probably want to use <b>cron</b> (or an equivalent
facility) to start a new production cycle each business night using an
entry similar to:<ul type=disc><pre>00 22 * * 1-5   csh -f /localvision/production/admin/daily.daemon</pre></ul> 

<p><hr>
<h3 id="directories">The Production Directory Structure (Unix)</h3>
<p>
The Vision Server Installation supplies two directories:
<i>/vision/</i> and <i>/localvision/</i>.  The <i>/localvision</i>
directory contains a sub-directory named <i>production/</i> which
manages all the directories, scripts, jobs, and tokens related to
production processing.
<p>
The <i>/localvision/production</i> directory contains the following
sub-directories:
<p>
<center><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=80%>
<tr> <th>Directory <th>Description
<tr><td valign=top><i>Reports/</i>
<td>
This directory contains the production report jobs and the current
and prior day's report output.
<tr><td valign=top><i>Updates/</i>
<td>
This directory contains the update jobs used for pre-defined updates
and the historical logs for pre-defined and ad-hoc updates.  
<tr><td valign=top><i>admin/</i>
<td>
This directory contains the tools to manage the daily production
cycle and the historical logs generated by prior production cycles.  

<tr><td valign=top><i>status/</i>
<td>
This directory shows the status of the current production
cycle.  The <i>active/</i> directory lists the update and/or report
that is currently in progress.
The <i>pending/</i> directory lists the names of the scheduled
update and report jobs that are waiting to run during this cycle.  
The <i>tokens/</i> directory shows the completed, canceled, 
and error status of jobs that have run during the current cycle.  
The <i>logs/</i> directory contains the log files associated with each 
update completed during the current cycle.  
<tr><td valign=top><i>utils/</i>
<td>This directory contains a number of utility programs.

</table></center>

<p><hr>
<h3 id="daily">Daily Production Cycle</h3>
<p>

The script <i>daily.daemon</i>, located in the directory 
<i>/localvision/production/admin</i>,
controls the nightly production cycle.  It is usually started by <b>cron</b>
every Monday through Friday evening using a <b>crontab</b> entry similar 
to:<ul type=disc><pre>00 22 * * 1-5   csh -f /localvision/production/admin/daily.daemon</pre></ul> 
which would start the daemon at 10:00 pm on weeknights.  This entry
is included for the Vision Administrator user code, referred to as
<i>dbadmin</i> in this document.
<p>
When the <i>daily.daemon</i> starts, a new production cycle begins.
If the prior night's production cycle is still running, it will
terminate when the new cycle begins.  The production cycle date is
the date on which the cycle begins.  This is also known as the
<b>process date</b>.  The process date is saved in an environment
variable (<i>processDate</i>) when the daemon begins.  The process
date remains unchanged during the production cycle which runs until a
new cycle begins or until it is terminated via manual intervention or a
system reboot.  
<p> 
The <i>daily.daemon</i> performs the following steps:
<ol> 
<p><li>Sets the process date and the day of the week.  
<ul> 
The environment variable <i>processDate</i>
is set to the date in <i>YYYYMMDD</i> format
when the daemon starts.  This environment variable remains constant
throughout the cycle.  The environment variable <i>dayOfWeek</i> is set to
the current day of the week and is used to determine which daily
setup file to read (see below).  
</ul>
<p><li>Deletes old files in the 
<i>/localvision/production/status</i> subdirectories.
<p><li>Sets up any special processing tokens for the current date and
day of the week.  
<p><li>Runs any scheduled Vision database maintenance activities (i.e.,
garbage collection, compaction, and/or segment deletion).  
<p><li>Starts the database update daemon in background.  
<p><li>Starts the production reporting daemon in background.  
<p><li>Mails the output from the setup and maintenance process to the
<i>dbadmin</i> user.
</ol>
<p>
If the setup or database maintenance steps fail for any reason, then
<i>daily.daemon</i> terminates.  A message is mailed to the <i>dbadmin</i>
user indicating that the process was halted and no updates or reports are
started.  If the maintenance activities complete successfully, the
<i>daily.daemon</i> starts two new daemons:  one to manage the production
updates (<i>runUpdates</i>) and one to manage the production reports
(<i>runReports</i>).  These processes will run throughout the cycle.
<p>
After initializing the update process for the current day's cycle,
the update daemon runs the process <i>processUpdates</i> which checks
every five minutes to see if any updates are pending.  After
initializing the report process for the current day's cycle, the
report daemon runs the process <i>processReports</i> which checks
every six minutes to see if any reports are pending.  These processes
will run until terminated or until the next night's cycle begins.  


<p>
<h4 id="dailyMaint">Daily Setup and Maintenance Activities</h4>
<p>
When it starts, the <i>daily.daemon</i> loads a command file defined
for the current day of the week.  The files <i>setup.Mon</i>,
<i>setup.Tue</i>, etc., located in the
<i>production/admin/helpers</i> directory, are used to create tokens
that are needed on a particular day of the week.  Minimally, these
files are used to schedule the three main database maintenance
activities to run each day by placing the following tokens
in the directory <i>/localvision/production/status/tokens</i>:
<p><blockquote>
<i>dsegs</i> ... schedule segment deletion to run<br>
<i>collect</i> ... schedule garbage collection to run<br>
<i>compact</i> ... schedule database compaction to run<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
The daily setup scripts can be modified to
reflect special procedures required by your organization on specific
days.
<p>
Once the daily setup script has been loaded, 
the daily maintenance procedures begin.
If the <i>dsegs</i> token exists, old database segments are deleted.  
If the <i>collect</i> token exists, the garbage collection process is
executed.  If the <i>compact</i>
token exists, a full compaction is run.  Note that if segment
deletion is scheduled, it runs first, prior to the current cycle's
compaction.  In other words, it removes the segment files that were 
compacted by the prior day's cycle.  Output from the current cycle's
garbage collection and compaction processing is stored in the
files <i>garbageCollect.log</i> and <i>compact.log</i> in
the directory <i>/localvision/production/status/logs</i>.
A permanent copy of the output is also saved in the directory
<i>/localvision/logs</i> with the process date added as an 
extension to the file name.
<p>
For more information about the maintenance procedures, see the document
<a href="admTools.htm"><i>Vision Network Administration Tools</i></a>.
<p>
<h4 id="dailyStatus">The Status Directory</h4>
<p>
The <i>/localvision/production/status</i> directory provides 
a snapshot of the current production cycle's activities.  
There are six subdirectories under the <i>status</i> directory:
<p><ul type=disc>
<table width=92%><tr><td><i>active/</i>
<td>This directory shows the update and/or report job that is
currently in progress.

<tr align=left valign=top><td><i>pending/</i>
<td>This directory lists the names of the scheduled update and report
jobs that are waiting to run during this cycle. 

<tr align=left valign=top><td><i>tokens/</i>
<td>This directory shows the completed, canceled, and error status of
jobs that have run during the current cycle.  This directory may include 
additional file tokens to set and help control job dependency conditions.

<tr align=left valign=top><td><i>logs/</i>
<td>This directory contains log files associated with each 
update completed during the current cycle.  In addition, this directory
contains the file <i>update.log</i> which shows the starting and ending
times for each update job that has completed, 
the file <i>submit.log</i> which shows the starting and ending
times for each submitted ad-hoc Vision update request that has completed,
the file <i>report.log</i> which shows the starting and ending
times for each report job that has completed,
and the file <i>errors.log</i> which
shows any errors encountered during the current cycle.  

<tr align=left valign=top><td><i>reports/</i>
<td>This directory contains output files associated with each report
job completed during the current cycle.  It is actually a link to the
directory <i>/localvision/production/Reports/output</i>. 

<tr align=left valign=top><td><i>todo/</i>
<td>This directory shows jobs from prior cycles that did not
complete successfully.  These token files serve as a reminder of
tasks that you may need to reschedule.  They can be removed by
the Database Administrator when they are no longer needed.
</table></ul>
<p>
For example, to see pending jobs use:  
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
ls pending</pre></b></ul>
and to see the status of completed and in progress jobs use: <ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
ls active tokens</pre></b></ul>
Many tokens are in the form  <i>prefix.jobName</i> where <i>prefix</i>
is one of:
<p><center><table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 width=80%>
<tr><th>Token Prefix <th>Definition
<tr><th>Done <td>Job has completed
<tr><th>Cancel <td>Job has been canceled
<tr><th>Error <td>Job completed and generated an error
<tr><th>Warning <td>Job completed and generated a warning
<tr><th>InProgress <td>Job is currently in progress
</table></center>
<p>
Several other tokens will exist in the <i>status/tokens</i> directory.  
The token <i>InProgress.yyyymmdd</i> (where yyyymmdd is the process date)
will exist if the cycle is still active.  The tokens
<i>updateDaemon.inProgress</i> and <i>reportDaemon.inProgress</i> 
will also exist to indicate whether the update and/or report daemons
are specifically running.  
<p>
The <i>logs</i> directory contains the
log files associated with each update completed during the current
cycle as well as a number of summary files.  To see all the logs
created during the current cycle use:  
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
ls logs</pre></b></ul>
To look at the overall process summary for updates run during the current 
cycle use:    
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
more logs/update.log</pre></b></ul>
which shows the start/stop time for each job that has run.  To look
at the errors generated by any job in the current cycle use:   
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
more logs/errors.log</pre></b></ul>
For each job that has run there should be a corresponding log file in
the <i>logs</i> directory named <i>logs/jobName.log</i>
containing details for that specific job for the current date's processing.  
<p>
<h4 id="dailyScheduling">Scheduling Update and Report Jobs</h4>
<p>
Update jobs are scheduled by placing the job name in the
<i>status/pending</i> directory.  For example, to schedule a job
named <i>Prices</i>, you would create the file 
<i>/localvision/production/status/pending/Prices</i>.  While the
production cycle is active, the <i>pending</i> directory is checked
every five minutes to see if any update jobs are waiting.  If a job
is pending and all required pre-conditions are met, the job will run.
The job name will appear in the <i>status/active</i> directory while
it is running.
Upon completion, the pending token will be removed.  If the job
completed successfully, the file token
<i>Done.jobName</i> will be placed in the <i>status/tokens</i>
directory where <i>jobName</i> refers to the job that was run (e.g.,
<i>Prices</i>).  If the job generated an error, the token
<i>Error.jobName</i> will be created in the <i>status/tokens</i> directory
instead.  If the job generated a warning, the token
<i>Warning.jobName</i> will be created in the <i>status/tokens</i> directory
in addition to <i>Done.jobName</i>.
<p>
The specific steps needed to create update <b>job</b> and <b>okay</b>
scripts are <a href="#updates">described later in this document</a>.
<p>
Report jobs are scheduled by placing the job name, prefixed by
<i>report.</i>, in the <i>status/pending</i> directory.
For example, to schedule a report job
named <i>PriceChanges</i>, you would create the file token named
<i>/localvision/production/status/pending/report.PriceChanges</i>.  
While the
production cycle is active, the <i>pending</i> directory is checked
every six minutes to see if any report jobs are waiting.  If a job
is pending and all required pre-conditions are met, the job will run.
The job name will appear in the <i>status/active</i> directory
while it is running.
Upon completion, the pending token will be removed.  Report output will
be saved in the directory <i>/localvision/production/Reports/output</i>.
<p>
The specific steps needed to create report <b>job</b> and <b>okay</b>
scripts are <a href="#reports">described later in this document</a>.
<p>
<h4 id="dailyTerminate">Production Cycle Termination and Restart</h4>
<p>
If the new production cycle is ready to start while a cycle is
in progress, the new process creates the token
<i>/localvision/production/status/active/daemon.WaitingToStart</i>,
to signal that it is waiting.  The current cycle will then perform the
following wrap-up tasks:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The files <i>update.log, report.log, submit.log, listener.log,
errors.log, and warnings.log</i> in the directory
<i>/localvision/production/status/logs</i> are copied to the directory
<i>/localvision/production/admin/logs</i> with the <i>log</i>
extension replaced by the process date.<p>
<li>For each update job remaining in the <i>status/pending</i> directory, 
the token <i>Pending.jobName.yyyymmdd</i>
is created in the <i>status/todo</i> directory.<p>
<li>For each job that generated an <i>Error</i> token, the token
<i>Error.jobName.yyyymmdd</i> is created in the <i>status/todo</i> directory.  
</ul>
<p>
By default, the update daemon runs until a new cycle is ready to
begin.  You can manually stop the update and/or report daemons
using: 
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
touch pending/updates.Stop 
touch pending/reports.Stop</pre></ul>
The same cycle wrap-up procedures described above are executed when
the cycle is manually terminated.  
<p>
To restart the processing daemon after it has been stopped manually
or as the result of a hardware reboot, use:  
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/admin
restart.daemon </pre></ul>
The update and/or report processing will be restarted if they are
not currently running.  
<p>
If the <i>daily.daemon</i> never started (e.g., because the machine was
unavailable or <b>cron</b> was not running), you can manually start it.  To
ensure the correct process date, you should create a file containing
the following environment variables:  
<ul type=disc><pre>setenv processDate 19981105 # date cron should have started 
setenv dayOfWeek   Thu      # day cron should have started</pre></b></ul>

This file should be supplied as an argument to the <i>daily.daemon</i>.  For
example, if you saved your environment variables in the file
<i>/localvision/production/admin/helpers/sample.env</i> use: 
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/admin
daily.daemon helpers/sample.env >& logs/nocron.yyyymmdd & </pre></ul>
<p>
<h4 id="dailyHoliday">Holiday Processing and Job Cancellation</h4>
<p>
To cancel the normal daily processing for holidays that occur during
the business week, you can store holiday dates in the directory
<i>/localvision/production/admin/holidays</i>.
For example, to prevent the normal daily processing from
running on 11/26/1998 use:   
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/admin
touch holidays/19981126 </pre></ul>
This technique can be used to set up holiday processing in advance of
the actual holiday.  
<p>
To cancel a specific job in advance of the current processing date,
create a token in the form:  
<ul type=disc><pre>yyyymmdd.Cancel.jobName</pre></ul>
in the <i>status/tokens</i> directory.  For example, if you receive a daily
file of Canadian prices and want to cancel this required job on a day
that is not a US holiday but is a Canadian holiday, you could use the
form:  
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
touch tokens/19980523.Cancel.PriceCanada </pre></ul>
<p><hr>
<h3 id="updates">Update Jobs</h3>
<p>
You will need to create an update job for each task that updates the
Vision database on a production basis.  For example, you would create
an update job to:  
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Wait for a required data set to arrive and start the appropriate
update script.  
<li>Run supplemental updates based on the completion of one or more
other update jobs.  
</ul>
<p>

<h4 id="updatesCreate">Creating Update Jobs </h4>
<p>
Update jobs are defined in the directory
<i>/localvision/production/Updates/jobs</i>.
Each job has a unique name and an associated <b>job script</b>, a Unix
script that contains the actual processing steps needed to perform
the update. This job script is named <i>jobName.job</i> where
<i>jobName</i> refers to the unique name of the job.  
 An optional <b>okay script</b> containing any pre-conditions for running the job may be defined as well. If you have any pre-conditions for running the job, you will also
create a file named <i>jobName.okay</i>.
<p>
For example, you could create a job
named <i>Prices.job</i> to perform the following steps:.  
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Start a Vision session using <i>batchvision</i>, logging the
output to a file.
<li>Load the price file using the <b>PriceFeed</b> data feed format.
<li>Update the database.
<li>Check for successful completion of update.
<li>Copy the log file from the update directory to the status area for
convenient access.  
<li>Exit with a status value of 0 if the update was successful, a
status of 1 if the update failed.
</ul>
<p>
For example, the file
<i>/localvision/production/Updates/jobs/Prices.job</i> could look
something like:  
<ul type=disc><pre>#!/bin/csh
#--  File: /localvision/production/Updates/jobs/Prices.job 
set jobName = Prices

#-- setup log file 
set workDir = /localvision/production/Updates/workArea/Internal
set processLog = $workDir/$jobName.log.$processDate

#-- Start Vision and Load the data file using the PriceFeed format
set dataFile = /localvision/upload/feeds/prices.dat

/vision/bin/batchvision -U3 &lt;&lt; EOInput  >& $processLog        

#--->  Vision input starts here   &lt;---
Interface BatchFeedManager
       upload: "PriceFeed" usingFile: $dataFile withConfig: NA ;
       Utility updateNetworkWithAnnotation: "$jobName Loads" ;
?g

#--->  End of Vision Input    &lt;---
EOInput

#--  Check job completion status
set okay = $status
if ($okay != 0) set okay = 1

#--  copy the log to global status area
cp $processLog $globalLogs/$jobName.log

#--  end exit with status
exit $okay</pre></b></ul>
<p>
Update jobs can be scheduled to run on a required or as needed basis.
If a job is scheduled, you may want it to wait until specific
conditions are met before it actually runs.  For example, you may
want to schedule the <i>Prices</i> job to run each day but you do not want
it to begin until the file <i>prices.dat</i> exists in a known directory.
If you have one or more of these conditions that must be met before a
scheduled job can begin, you can create an <b>okay script</b>, a Unix script
that returns a status indicating if the job is ready to run.  If
conditions are ready, this script should return a status value of 0.
If conditions are not ready, this script should return a value of 1.
If conditions exist that indicate that the job should be canceled,
this script should return a value of 2.  
<p>
For example, the file <i>/localvision/production/Updates/jobs/Prices.okay</i>
could look something like:  
<ul type=disc><pre>#!/bin/csh
#--  File: /localvision/production/Updates/jobs/Prices.okay 
if (-f /localvision/upload/feeds/prices.dat ) exit 0

exit 1</pre></ul>

<p>
<h4 id="updatesSched">Scheduling Update Jobs</h4>
<p>
To schedule an update job, you create a token containing the job name in
the <i>status/pending</i> directory.  For example, to manually schedule the
<i>Prices</i> job:  
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
touch pending/Prices </pre></ul>
While the production cycle is active, the <i>pending</i> directory is
checked every five minutes to see if any jobs are waiting.  If a job
is pending and its <b>okay script</b> returns the value 0 (or no <b>okay
script</b> is defined), the job will execute.  If the job
succeeds (returns a status of 0), the token
<i>Done.jobName</i> will be placed in the <i>status/tokens</i> directory.
If the job
returns a status of 1, the token <i>Error.jobName</i> will be created
in the <i>status/tokens</i> directory.  
If the job returns a status code of 2, the
tokens <i>Done.jobName</i> and <i>Warning.jobName</i> will be created in the
<i>status/tokens</i> directory.  
<p>
The starting and ending time for each update job is logged in the
file <i>update.log</i> in the directory
<i>/localvision/production/status/logs</i>.  
<p>
Required jobs can automatically be added to the <i>pending</i> directory
when the production cycle begins.  The job tokens defined in the
<i>/localvision/production/Updates/required</i> directory are copied to the
<i>status/pending</i> directory at the start of the cycle.  
For example, to schedule the <i>Prices</i> job to run automatically each
day:  
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/Updates
touch required/Prices </pre></ul>
When jobs are automatically scheduled this way, your <b>okay
script</b> would supply the rules to indicate when processing conditions are
ready.  Alternatively, an independent process could place the job
token in the <i>pending</i> directory when conditions for processing have
been satisfied.  A sample set of production jobs are described
in the section <a href="#pma"><i>Sample Production Environment</i></a>.
<p>
To cancel a job currently in <i>pending</i>, 
you could manually remove it from the
<i>pending</i> directory.  If other jobs are dependent on this job's
completion, this approach will not produce the appropriate tokens. Alternatively, you could leave the token in <i>pending</i> and create the
token <i>Cancel.jobName</i> in the <i>status/tokens</i> directory.  
For example: 
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
touch tokens/Cancel.Prices </pre></ul>
When the daemon next cycles through the pending jobs, it will remove
the <i>Prices</i> token from pending and create the <i>Done.Prices</i>
token.  The <i>Cancel.Prices</i> token will remain in the 
<i>status/tokens</i> directory for the remainder of the cycle.

<p>
<h4 id="updatesPredefined">Pre-defined Update Jobs</h4>
<p>
Your installation includes several pre-defined update jobs in the
<i>/localvision/production/Updates/jobs</i> directory:
<p>
<ul><i>DailyCleanup.job</i>
<ul>This job runs a standard set of procedures designed to follow
the major updates for the day.  All work is performed in the
directory <i>/localvision/production/Updates/workArea/Cleanup</i>.
Various Vision methods will run.  Output is logged to the file
<i>logs/daily.yyyymmdd</i> in this directory.
The token <i>DailyCleanup</i> is
included in the <i>Updates/required</i> directory so that this job
is automatically scheduled to run each day.
</ul></ul>

<ul><i>StartListeners.job</i>
<ul>This job is used to restart the master listeners associated with
web-basis access.
The token <i>StartListeners</i> is
included in the <i>Updates/required</i> directory so that this job
is automatically scheduled to run each day.  The
<i>StartListeners.okay</i> script instructs the job to wait until the
<i>DailyCleanup</i> update has finished.
</ul></ul>

<ul><i>ShutListeners.job</i>
<ul>This job is used to shut down any master listeners associated 
with web-based access that are currently running.
</ul></ul>

<ul><i>Suspend.job</i>
<ul>This job is used to temporarily prevent any other updates from
running.  It will continue to run until you remove it from
<i>pending</i>.  To temporarily suspend updates, use: 
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
touch pending/Suspend </pre></b></ul>
To continue the updates, use: 
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
"rm" pending/Suspend </pre></b>
</ul></ul></ul>

<h3 id="reports">Report Jobs</h3>
<p>
Production report jobs are managed in the 
<i>/localvision/production/Reports</i> directory.
This directory includes the <i>jobs</i> directory which contains
the actual report jobs, the <i>output</i> directory which contains
the output generated during the current production cycle and the
<i>oldoutput</i> directory which contains the output generated during the
prior production cycle.
<p>
Production reports are executed daily unless the day has been 
<a href="#dailyHoliday">flagged as a holiday</a>.
When the production reports daemon begins, the following steps are 
executed:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li> The prior cycle's output is copied from the <i>output</i> to the
<i>oldoutput</i> directory in <i>/localvision/production/Updates/Reports</i>.
<li>Unprocessed jobs remaining in the 
<i>/localvision/production/status/pending</i> directory are purged.  
<li>A <i>pending</i> job token is created for each job in the 
<i>Reports/jobs</i> directory.
</ul>

<p>
<h4 id="reportsCreate">Creating Report Jobs </h4>
<p>
You will need to create a report job for each production report you wish
to run.  Report jobs are defined in the directory
<i>/localvision/production/Reports/jobs</i>.
Each job has a unique name and an associated <b>job script</b>, a Vision
script that contains the actual Vision code that generates the reports.
An optional <b>okay script</b> containing any
pre-conditions for running the report job and an optional
<b>wrapup script</b> containing any steps to run after the output
has been generated may be defined as well.
This job script is named <i>jobName.job</i> where
<i>jobName</i> refers to the unique name of the job.  
If you have any pre-conditions for running the job, you will also
create a file named <i>jobName.okay</i>.  If you have any steps to
run after the option has been created, you will include them in 
a file named <i>jobName.wrapup</i>.  The rules for
defining an <b>okay script</b> for a report job are the same as for an
update job.  You can also define a wrapup script which runs after the
report job has completed.  This script can contain any additional
Unix commands you require.
<p>
For example, you could create a report job
named <i>PriceChanges</i> to display all prices that have changed
by more than a certain amount since the prior date.  The file
<i>PriceChanges.job</i> would contain the actual Vision code to generate this
report.  The file <i>PriceChanges.okay</i> would contain
any conditions that must be satisfied prior to starting the job,
such as successful completion of the <i>Prices</i> update job.
<p>
The <i>PriceChanges</i> job could look something like: 
<ul type=disc><pre>
#--  File: /localvision/production/Reports/jobs/PriceChanges.job
#--  Note - this is a Vision script

!cutoff <- 10 ;
!baseDate <- ^today - 1 businessDays ;
Security masterList
   select: [ getPriceRecord date = ^my baseDate ] .
do: [ !current <- price ;
      !prior <- :price asOf: ^my baseDate - 1 businessDays ;
      !pch <- current pctChangeTo: prior ;
      pch absoluteValue > ^my cutoff
      ifTrue: 
        [ code print: 10 ; name print ; 
          current print ; prior print ; pch printNL ;
        ]
    ] t;</pre></ul>
<p>
The <i>PriceChanges.okay</i> file could look something like: 
<ul type=disc><pre>#!/bin/csh
#--  File: /localvision/production/Reports/jobs/PriceChanges.okay
#--  Note - this is a Unix script

#-- wait for Prices update to finish
if (-f /localvision/production/status/tokens/Done.Prices ) exit 0

exit 1</pre></ul>
<p>
The <i>PriceChanges.wrapup</i> file could look something like: 
<ul type=disc><pre>#!/bin/csh
#--  File: /localvision/production/Reports/jobs/PriceChanges.wrapup
#--  Note - this is a Unix script

mailx dbadmin << @@@EOF
The Price Changes Report is Done
@@@EOF
</pre></ul>
<p>
<h4 id="reportsSched">Scheduling Report Jobs</h4>
<p>
To schedule a report job, you create a token containing the job name 
prefixed by <i>report.</i> in the directory
<i>/localvision/production/status/pending</i>. 
All the production report jobs in the <i>Reports/jobs</i> directory
are automatically scheduled to run at the start of each cycle,
unless the day has been <a href="#dailyHoliday">flagged as a holiday</a>.  To rerun a job or
to schedule a new job that has been added after the current cycle
began, you can manually create the appropriate token: 
<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/status
touch pending/report.PriceChanges</pre></ul>
While the production cycle is active, the <i>pending</i> directory is
checked every six minutes to see if any jobs are waiting.  If a job
is pending and its <b>okay script</b> returns the value 0 (or no <b>okay
script</b> is defined), the job will execute.  
Output from the job is stored in 
<i>/localvision/production/Reports/output/jobName.out</i>.  If the output
contains <i>formatter</i> commands, it is automatically run through the
<i>formatter</i> utility.  If there is a <b>wrapup script</b> defined
for the job, it is executed when the job has completed.  
<p>
The starting and ending time for each report job is logged in the
file report.log in the directory <i>/localvision/production/status/logs/</i>.  
<p>
To cancel a report, remove its token from the <i>status/pending</i>
directory.

<p>
<h4 id="reportsPredefined">Pre-defined Report Jobs</h4>
<p>
Your installation includes several pre-defined report jobs in the
<i>/localvision/production/Reports/jobs</i> directory:
<p>
<ul><i>currencySample.job</i>
<ul>This report shows currencies that have had a large change
in US dollar exchange rate since the prior date and currencies
that have not had their exchange rates updated for a while.
Sample <b>okay</b> and <b>wrapup</b> scripts for this job are
also supplied.
</ul></ul>
<ul><i>spaceSample.job</i>
<ul>This report shows disk space usage and structure counts for
each object space in your current database.  Its <b>okay script</b>
prevents the job from executing until the <i>DailyCleanup</i> update
has finished successfully.
</ul></ul>


<p><hr>
<h3 id="pma">Sample Production Environment</h3>
<p>

Sample jobs that can be used in a typical portfolio management
environment are provided with all installations that include the
Portfolio Management Application Layer.  The following sample files
can be found in the <i>/localvision/production/Updates/jobs</i>
directory: <i>MiscMasters.job, SecurityPlus.job, 
HoldingsPlus.job, HoldingsPlus.okay, PricePlus.job, 
and DailyCleanup.okay</i>.  For many installations, these jobs can
be used as a starting point for managing daily updates.
<p>
These jobs and the production process are described in detail
in the document
<a href="pmaProduction.htm"><i>Sample Production Environment</i></a>.

<p><hr>
<h3 id="submits">Submitting Ad-Hoc Updates</h3>
<br>
The <b>visionSubmit</b> utility is a Unix script that allows a
user to submit ad-hoc Vision code and data feeds to the update
queue.  This utility may be restricted to the <i>dbadmin</i> user,
or it can be made available to other users, as appropriate.
<p>
Submitted requests are validated and added to the update queue
for processing.  Prior to update, these submitted jobs will
appear in the directory <i>/localvision/production/status/pending</i>
with the prefix <i>submit</i>.  Once processed, the output from
these updates will be stored in the <i>/localvision/production/status/logs</i>
directory for the remainder of the current production cycle.
Permanent copies of the submitted requests and output are retained
historically in the <i>/localvision/production/Updates/submits/posted</i>
and <i>/localvision/production/Updates/submits/logs</i> directories.
<p>
You can use the <b>visionSubmit</b> utility to submit ad-hoc Vision
code and data feed updates.  You can invoke the utility with
parameters or you will be prompted for various pieces of information
needed to submit the request.  Note that if this command does not
work, you may need to check your Unix configuration.  This command is
an alias for the script
<i>/localvision/production/admin/scripts/submitUpdate</i>.

<p>
<h4 id="submitsCode">Submitting Ad-Hoc Vision Code Updates</h4>
<p>
You may need to load and save new Vision scripts into 
your database for several reasons such as report modifications,
new applications, and corrections that cannot be performed via
data feed files.  You may receive Vision files from 
your Insyte consultant and/or develop your own code.
<p>
Although you can submit a file from any directory, by convention, files containing Vision code to submit are placed in the directory <i>/localvision/upload/vscripts</i> .  To submit the Vision code
for update, type: <ul type=disc><pre>visionSubmit -C</pre></ul>at the Unix prompt.  You will be prompted as follows:
<ul type=disc><pre>Vision Input Code File:           #- name of code file

Run in Space [3]:                 #- carriage return or alternate space 

Test File Before Submitting?      #- Yes or No</pre></ul>

If the supplied file is okay, you will see a message of the form:
<ul type=disc><pre>***  Vision Code File Update Pending. File: submitCode.dbadmin.32</pre></ul>
This indicates that this is the 32nd submit for user code
<i>dbadmin</i>.  You will see the pending token
<i>submitCode.dbadmin.32</i> in the
<i>/localvision/production/status/pending/</i> directory.  
<p>
You can avoid the prompts by supplying the inputs on one line.
For example: 
<ul type=disc><pre>visionSubmit -C myfile</pre></b></ul>

You will not be prompted for the file name in this case, but you
will be prompted for the object space and testing option.  To avoid
the prompting, supply all inputs or use the <b>-n</b> option:
<ul type=disc><pre>visionSubmit -C myfile 3 no
</b>
or
<b>
visionSubmit -C -n myfile</b>

</pre></ul>
<h4 id="submitsFeed">Submitting Ad-Hoc DataFeed Updates</h4>
<p>

It is sometimes useful to load data using a <b>DataFeed</b> format
for a data feed that is not part of pre-defined update job.  You
can use <b>visionSubmit</b> to load these feeds.
By convention, feed files are placed in the 
directory <i>/localvision/upload/feeds</i>, although
you can submit a feed file from any directory.  To submit the feed
for update, type: <ul type=disc><pre>visionSubmit -F</pre></ul>at the Unix prompt.  You will be prompted as follows:

<ul type=disc><pre>Vision Input Feed File:              #- name of feed file

Data Feed Name:                      #- name of DataFeed format

Optional Configuration File Name:    #- name of optional config file </pre></ul>

If the supplied file is okay, you will see a message of the form:
<ul type=disc><pre>***  Vision Feed File Update Pending. File: submitFeed.dbadmin.33</pre></ul>
This indicates that this is the 33rd submit for user code
<i>dbadmin</i>.  You will see the pending token
<i>submitFeed.dbadmin.33</i> in the
<i>/localvision/production/status/pending/</i> directory.  
<p>
You can avoid the prompts by supplying the inputs on one line.
For example: 
<ul type=disc><pre>visionSubmit -F currency.dat CurrencyMaster currency.cfg
</b> 
or
<b>
visionSubmit -F -n currency.dat CurrencyMaster</pre></ul>

<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>

<p>
<b>Question: </b>
<ul>
<i>I placed a job in the </i>status/pending<i> directory and it
has not run.  What is going on?</i>
</ul>
<b>Answer:</b>
<ul>Check to see if you have an <b>okay script</b> that specifies
conditions that would keep the job from running.  If this is an
update job, the corresponding <i>okay</i> script is in the directory
<i>/localvision/production/Updates/jobs</i>.  If this is a report job,
the corresponding <i>okay</i> script is in the directory
<i>/localvision/production/Reports/jobs</i>.  
<p>
You should also check to make sure <a href="#reallyrunning">the update and report processing
are actually running</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Question: </b>
<ul>
<i>There are a number of files in the </i>status/todo<i> directory
that start with the prefix </i>Pending<i>.  What should I do with these?</i>
</ul>
<b>Answer:</b>
<ul>When a new cycle begins, any jobs that are still pending in the
current cycle are copied to the <i>status/todo</i> directory with
a suffix of the process date.  This is just a reminder that a 
particular job did not run as expected on this date.  Jobs that
encountered errors are also saved in this directory.  Once you
have taken the appropriate action (which may be doing nothing),
you can remove these files.
</ul>
<p id="reallyrunning"><b>Question:</b>
<ul>
<i>How can I tell if the update and report daemons are really running?</i>
</ul>
<b>Answer:</b>
<ul>In Unix, you can use variations of the <i>ps</i> commands to see
the process status for a user code.  If the production process is
running under the user code <i>dbadmin</i>, you can type: 
<ul type=disc><pre>ps -fu dbadmin</pre></ul>

at the Unix prompt.  If the update daemon is running, you should see
entries similar to:
<ul type=disc><pre>dbadmin 10251  1        0   Nov 3   ?   0:00 scripts/runUpdates
dbadmin 10262 10251     0   Nov 3   ?   1:54 scripts/processUpdates </pre></ul>
If the report daemon is running, you should see entries similar to:<ul type=disc><pre>dbadmin 10252  1        0   Nov 3   ?   0:00 scripts/runReports
dbadmin 10266 10252     0   Nov 3   ?   1:54 scripts/processReports</pre></ul>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Question: </b>
<ul>
<i>How can I avoid waiting five or six minutes before the </i>status/pending<i>
directory is checked again?</i>
</ul>
<b>Answer:</b>
<ul>In Unix, the <i>processUpdates</i> and <i>processReports</i> tasks
run the <i>sleep 300</i> and <i>sleep 360</i> commands each time they
are done processing the current jobs in the pending queue.  You can
"kill the sleeps" to force either of these tasks to re-examine the
pending queue.  For example:<ul type=disc><pre>ps -fu dbadmin | grep sleep           #- show the sleep tasks
</b>
displays:
<b>
dbadmin 22183 10262  0 13:39:37 ?         0:00 sleep 300
dbadmin 22160 10266  0 13:36:54 ?         0:00 sleep 360</pre></ul>
To force the update daemon to re-examine the pending queue, use
the Unix <i>kill</i> command to remove the <i>sleep 300</i> task:<ul type=disc><pre>kill 22183
</pre></ul>
The next update job in the <i>status/pending</i> directory will begin
processing immediately.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Question: </b>
<ul>
<i>What happens to the update and report daemons if the hardware 
is rebooted?</i>
</ul>
<b>Answer:</b>
<ul>Unless your hardware administrator has arranged to automatically
start these processes, they will not be running after a reboot.
You can manually restart them using:<ul type=disc><pre>cd /localvision/production/admin
restart.daemon
</pre></ul>
Your system administrator can add this step to an appropriate script
that is automatically run after a reboot.  Note that this step should
be started by the <i>dbadmin</i> user (or the user code defined as
the Vision Administrator for your environment).
</ul>
