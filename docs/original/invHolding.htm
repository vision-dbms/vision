The class <b>Holding</b> is used  to  represent  a  specific  holding  by  an
account  in  a  security as of a specific point in time.  Holdings are
rarely (if ever) referenced directly.  Instead they are accessed via a
particular  security  or account.  In general, holdings are created as
part of the process that updates the  accounts  each  day.   Key  data
items  such as <i>totalMarketValue</i> and <i>percentOfPort</i> for each Holding
and   Account  summary  information  such  as  <i>totalMarketValue</i>  and
<i>totalCost</i> are also computed at this time.
<p>

The Holding data structure is illustrated below:

The following key messages are defined for the class Holding:
<p>

<center><table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><b>Property</b><td><b>Returns
<tr><td>account<td>Account instance represented by holding
<tr><td>security<td>Security instance represented by holding
<tr><td>date<td>Date represent by holding
<tr><td>baseCurrency<td>Currency in which monetary values are
represented (initialized to account's value)
<tr><td>_shares<td>Unadjusted shares owned by account in security
<tr><td>shares<td>Split adjusted shares owned by acct in security
<tr><td>_totalMarketValue<td>Unadjusted market value of shares owned using
price on holding date in baseCurrency
<tr><td>totalMarketValue<td>Currency adjusted market value
<tr><td>_totalCost<td>Unadjusted cost of shares owned in baseCurrency
<tr><td>totalCost<td>Currency adjusted cost
<tr><td>percentOfPort<td>Weight of this holding by market value relative
to market value of account
<tr><td>percentOfEquity<td>Weight of this holding by market value relative
to equity market value of account
</table></center>
<p>

Each Holding responds to the  messages  <i>security</i>  and  <i>account</i>  by
returning  an  instance  of  those  classes;  therefore,  any messages
defined at Security or  Account  can  be  referenced  via  a  specific
Holding.   The  message  <i>id</i>  has been defined at Holding to return a
string in the form  <i>securityCode---accountCode</i>.   For  example,  the
<i>id</i> for a holding of security GM in portfolio XYZ would display as:

<pre><b>    37044210---XYZ  </b></pre>

Unlike the entity classes described so far, you do not create holdings
directly.  Instead various methods have been defined which can be used
as part of  the  production  cycle  or  interactively  to  create  and
maintain holdings.  
<hr>

<a name="Holdings Access"><h3>Holdings Access</h3></a>


The message <i>holdings</i> is defined for the class Security  and  Account
to  return the list of holdings associated with the instance as of the
current evaluation date. Since the message <i>holdings</i> returns a  List,
any  message  defined  for  the  List  class  can be sent (e.g., do: ,
select: , groupedBy:, sortUp: , etc.).  For example:

<pre><b>    Named Portfolio XYZ holdings
    do: [
        security name print: 30 ;               #-- security level
        security price print: 10 ;              #-- security level
        totalMarketValue printNL: 15 ;          #-- holding level
        ] ;

    Named Portfolio XYZ holdings
    groupedBy: [ security company country ] .
    do: [
        code print: 10 ; name printNL ;         #-- country level
        groupList sortDown: [ percentOfPort ] .
        do: [
            security name print: 30 ;           #-- security level
            security price print: 10 ;          #-- security level
            totalMarketValue print: 15 ;        #-- holding level
            percentOfPort printNL ;             #-- holding level
            ] ;
       newLine print ;
       ] ;
</b></pre>

The message <i>getHoldingIn:</i> is used to get an account's holding  in  a
specific  security if it exists.  A default holding record is returned
otherwise.  For example:

<pre><b>    Named Portfolio XYZ
      getHoldingIn: Named Security GM . percentOfPort </b></pre>

returns the percentage of the Portfolio XYZ represented by the holding
in  GM.   The  message  <i>holds:</i> is used to indicate whether or not an
account holds a specific security.  It returns a boolean  value.   For
example:

<pre><b>    Portfolio masterList
      select: [ ^self holds: ^global Named Security GM ] .
</b></pre>

returns the list of all portfolios that currently hold GM.


The message  <i>holdings</i>  is  used  to  access  the  list  of  holdings
associated with a Security as well.  For example:

<pre><b>    Named Security GM  holdings
    do: [
        account code print: 30 ;                     #--  account level
        account portfolioManager name print: 20 ;    #--  account level
        security price print: 10 ;                   #--  security level
        totalMarketValue print: 15 ;                 #--  holding level
        newLine print ;
        ] ;


    Named Security GM holdings
    groupedBy: [ account portfolioManager ] .
    do: [
        code print: 10 ; name printNL ;              #-- manager level
        groupList sortDown: [ percentOfPort] .
        do: [
            account name print: 30 ;                 #-- account level
            totalMarketValue print: 15 ;             #-- holding level
            percentOfPort printNL ;                  #-- holding level
            ] ;
        newLine print ;
        ] ;
</b></pre>

Note that the list  of  holdings  includes  holdings  in  any  account
subclass.   If  you  want to restrict this list to the holdings in the
portfolio class only, use the expression:

<pre><b>    Named Security GM holdings
      select: [ account isPortfolio ] .
    do: [
        ] ;
</b></pre>

The message <i>getHoldingIn:</i> is used to get a security's holding  in  a
specific  account  if it exists.  A default holding record is returned
otherwise.  For example:

<pre><b>    Named Security GM
        getHoldingIn: Named Portfolio XYZ  . percentOfPort
</b></pre>

Since holdings are stored over time, you can access a portfolio as  of
a different date using the standard Vision techniques.  For example:

<pre><b>    9311 evaluate:
       [
       Named Portfolio XYZ holdings
       do: [
           security name print: 30 ;
           security price print: 10 ;
           totalMarketValue printNL: 15 ;
           ] ;
       ]
</b></pre>

displays the holdings information as of Nov  30,  1993.   The  message
<i>holdingsDate</i>  can  be  used  to  display  the  effective date of the
holdings list being accessed.  For example:

<pre><b>    9311 evaluate:
       [
       Named Portfolio XYZ
       do: [ "Holdings As Of: " print; holdingsDate printNL ;
              holdings
              do: [
                  security name print: 30 ;
                  security price print: 10 ;
                  totalMarketValue printNL: 15 ;
                  ] ;
           ]
       ] ;
</b></pre>

The message <i>hasHoldings</i> is defined for the Account class to indicate
whether  an account has holdings as of the current evaluate date.  For
example, the expression:

<pre><b>    Portfolio masterList select: [ hasHoldings ]  </b></pre>

returns the list of portfolios that  have  current  holdings  and  the
expression:

<pre><b>    9311 evaluate:
       [ Portfolio masterList select: [ hasHoldings ]
       ]
</b></pre>

returns the list of portfolios that had holdings as of Nov 30, 1993.

The actual holding instance  lists  are  stored  in  the  time  series
property   <i>holdingsSeries</i>  defined  for  the  Security  and  Account
classes. To support the possibility of future  reorganization  of  the
holdings  data  structure  for  performance  and  storage  reason, the
<i>holdings</i> message has been defined to return the list stored  in  the
<i>holdingsSeries</i>  time  series  as of the evaluation date.  Unless you
are explicitly writing methods that update the time series, you should
use  the  <i>holdings</i>  message  to access your data.  In this way, your
code will be immune to any changes that may be made to the  underlying
property that manages the actual time series data.
<p>

<a name="The Holdings Creation Process"><h3>The Holdings Creation Process</h3></a>

 
A holding in a Portfolio represents the actual number of  shares  held
by the portfolio in a security on a specific date. A single holding is
created by aggregating the  individual  tax  lots  associated  with  a
single  security  in  an  account.   As a result, there is one Holding
created for each account/security pair included  in  the  taxlot  feed
from  the  accounting system.  Section 10 describes the taxlot feed in
more detail.
<p>

An AggAccount's holdings  are  created  by  collecting  the  tax  lots
associated  with  each  of its member portfolios and creating a single
holding for each distinct security represented.   After  the  holdings
have   been   created,   Portfolio   and   AggAccount   instances  are
interchangeable.  Holdings can  also  be  generated  for  IndexAccount
instances;  however,  since  these updates are not dependent on actual
accounting data feeds these holdings are often  created  interactively
as needed.
<p>

Whenever the tax lot data is updated by  the  accounting  system,  new
holdings  are  created  for  all  Portfolios  with  tax  lots  and any
AggAccount with <i>autoPrecalcsFlag</i> set to  TRUE  (all  AggAccounts  by
default).    The   <i>createHoldingsFromTaxlots</i>  message  is  executed,
performing the following steps:
<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Creates a new Holding instance for each security  represented  in
the  taxlots.   Normally,  a  single  holding  is created for the
security  <i>Named  Security  CashUS</i>  that   includes   all   cash
instruments.
<p>
<li>Updates the shares, total market value, and total cost properties
for each holding.
<p>
<li>Updates the <i>holdingsSeries</i> time series for the Account with the
new  list of holdings.  Note that the message <i>holdings</i> accesses
this time series.
<p>
<li>Executes the <i>computeAccountTotals</i> message.
</ul>
<p=2>

The message <i>computeAccountTotals</i> performs the following steps:
<ul type=disc>
<li>Updates the following properties for the account:</ul><dl>
<center><table>
<tr><td>_totalMarketValue
<tr><td>_totalMarketValueCash
<tr><td>_totalMarketValueEquity
<tt><td>_totalMarketValueFixed
<tr><td>_totalCost
</table></center>
<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Updates the properties <i>percentOfPort</i> and <i>percentOfEquity</i>  for
each holding in the account.
</ul>
<p>

After all the Portfolio and AggAccount holdings have been created  and
the  account  totals  computed,  the  holdings are cross referenced by
security using the Security message <i>rebuildHoldings</i>.
<p>

The  <i>doPrecalcs</i>  message performs  the following steps:
<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Updates    the    AggAccount's <i>memberList</i>    using    the
<i>updateMembership</i> message if the member list is rule-based.
<p>
<li>Updates the <i>taxlots</i> property  with  the  list  of  all  taxlots
defined in any of the AggAccount's member portfolios.
<p>
<li>Executes the <i>createHoldingsFromTaxlots</i> message described above.
</ul>
<p>

<hr>

<a name="IndexAccount Holdings"><h3>IndexAccount Holdings</h3></a>

Unlike  the  Portfolio  and  AggAccount  classes,  holdings  for   the
IndexAccount  class  are  not  dependent  on a feed from an accounting
system. Four techniques have been supplied for generating holdings for
instances   of   the   IndexAccount   class.    Creating  holdings  is
advantageous if you wish to use an IndexAccount interchangeably with a
Portfolio or AggAccount in an application.  The messages:

<pre><b>    createEvenDollarHoldingsAsOf: aDate
    createEvenShareHoldingsAsOf: aDate
    createMCapWeightedHoldingsAsOf: aDate
    createMValWeightedHoldingsAsOf: aDate using: anAccount
</b></pre>

can be used to build holdings based  on  the  IndexAccount's  security
list  as  of  a  date.  The  first  three messages require a date as a
parameter.  The last message creates holdings as of the supplied  date
weighted  by the security's holding in the supplied account.  All four
messages  execute  the   <i>createHoldingsFromMembers</i>   message   which
performs the following steps:
<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>Purges any holdings that already exist for the evaluation date.
<p>
<li>Initializes the total market value and total cost  properties  to
NA as of the evaluation date.
<p>
<li>Executes  the <i>getMembers</i>  message  for  the  IndexAccount  and
creates  a  holding  for  each  security  member.   This  list of
holdings is assigned to the IndexAccount's holdings  time  series
as of the evaluation date.
</ul>
<p>

The <i>createEvenDollarHoldingsAsOf:</i>  message assumes  that  $1,000  is
invested  in  each  security  in  the  index.   In  other  words,  the
<i>totalMarketValue</i> for each security is 1000.  Shares are computed for
each  holding  as the total market value divided by the security price
in the account's base currency.   The  message  <i>computeAccountTotals</i>
described   in   the   previous  section  is  then  executed  for  the
IndexAccount.  For example:

<pre><b>    Named IndexAccount MyIndex createEvenDollarHoldingsAsOf: ^today ;
    Named IndexAccount MyIndex holdings
    do: [ security code print: 10 ;
          totalMarketValue print: 15 ;        #- 1000 for all
          shares print ;
          percentOfPort printNL ;             #- 1/count * 100 for all
        ] ;
   <i>Total Account Market Value: </i> print ;
   Named IndexAccount MyIndex totalMarketValue printNL: 15 ;
</b></pre>

The <i>createEvenShareHoldingsAsOf:</i>  message assumes that you  purchase
1000  shares  of  each  security  in  the  index.  In other words, the
<i>shares</i> for each security is 1000.  Total market  value  is  computed
for  each  holding  as  the  shares  times  the  security price in the
account's base currency.  The message <i>computeAccountTotals</i> described
in  the  previous  section is then executed for the IndexAccount.  For
example:

<pre><b>    Named IndexAccount MyIndex createEvenShareHoldingsAsOf: ^today ;
    Named IndexAccount MyIndex holdings
    do: [ security code print: 10 ;
          totalMarketValue print: 15 ;
          shares print ;                          #- 1000 for all
          percentOfPort printNL ;
        ] ;
    <i>Total Account Market Value: </i> print ;
    Named IndexAccount MyIndex totalMarketValue printNL: 15 ;
</b></pre>

The  <i>createMCapWeightedHoldingsAsOf:</i>   message  assumes   that   you
purchase all the outstanding shares of each security in the index.  In
other words, the <i>shares</i> for each security is equal to the  value  of
<i>security sharesOut</i>.  Total market value is computed for each holding
as the shares times the security price in the account's base currency.
The  message  <i>computeAccountTotals</i> described in the previous section
is then executed for the IndexAccount.  For example:

<pre><b>    Named IndexAccount MyIndex createMCapWeightedHoldingsAsOf: ^today ;
    Named IndexAccount MyIndex holdings
    do: [ security code print: 10 ;
          totalMarketValue print: 15 ;
          shares print ;                          #- sharesOut for all
          percentOfPort printNL ;
        ] ;
    <i>Total Account Market Value: </i> print ;
    Named IndexAccount MyIndex totalMarketValue printNL: 15 ;
</b></pre>
  
The <i>createMValWeightedHoldingsAsOf:using:</i>  message assumes that  you
purchase  the equivalent number of shares held in the supplied account
for each security in the index.  Total market value  is  computed  for
each  holding  as the shares times the security price in the account's
base currency.  The message <i>computeAccountTotals</i>  described  in  the
previous section is then executed for the IndexAccount.  For example:

<pre><b>    Named IndexAccount MyIndex
       createMValWeightedHoldingsAsOf: ^today
       using: Named Portfolio XYZ ;
    Named IndexAccount MyIndex holdings
    do: [ security code print: 10 ;
          totalMarketValue print: 15 ;
          shares print ;                        #- shares in XYZ or 0
          percentOfPort printNL ;
        ] ;
    <i>Total Account Market Value: </i> print ;
    Named IndexAccount MyIndex totalMarketValue printNL: 15 ;
</b></pre>

The message <i>createWeightedHoldingsAsOf: date using: account</i>  can  be
used  to create a holdings structure that responds to market value and
percentage held messages for the different types of weighting schemes.
This message extends the holdings list with the following variables:

<pre><b>    pctEvenDollar
    mvalEvenDollar
    pctMCapWeighted
    mvalMCapWeighted
    pctMValWeighted
    mvalMValWeighted
</b></pre>

The summary statistics are not recomputed  with  this  message,  since
several different market value numbers are defined.
<p>

Once the holdings have been created, you may want to explicitly change
the shares value for one more holding.  The message: <i>setSharesIn:to:</i>
is used to reset the value of shares for the holdings in the  security
specified.  For example:

<pre><b>    Named IndexAccount MyIndex
      setSharesIn: Named Security IBM to: 500 ;
</b></pre>

After you have changed the shares in one or more securities  you  will
need  to  execute  the <i>computeAccountTotals</i> message to recompute the
IndexAccount market values and the holding percentages.
<p>

Note that the create messages should only  be  used  if  you  wish  to
generate   holdings   The   message   <i>getMemberWeightsUsingAccount:</i>,
described in the previous section, is more efficient for  applications
that do not need account level summary statistics.

<a name="New Instances and Additional Messages"><h3>New Instances and Additional Messages</h3></a>

Holding instances are usually created and  maintained  as  part  of  a
nightly  production  cycle.   The  specific processing rules used vary
based on your installation's policies.  
<p>

Your installation may have defined many additional  messages  for  the
Holding  class.   The  <i>showMessages</i> message is the fastest way to
determine the current list of messages available  for  a  class.   For
example:
