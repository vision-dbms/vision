<a name="Overview"><h3>Overview</h3></a>

The  class  <b>Account</b>  is  a  super  class  of  the  classes  <b>Portfolio</b>,
<b>AggAccount</b>,  and  <b>IndexAccount</b>.   A Portfolio is defined as an account
whose holdings are created via a  feed  from  an  internal  accounting
system.  The actual portfolio instances may represent <i>real</i> or <i>test</i>
portfolios.  An AggAccount is defined as an account whose holdings are
created  by combining the holdings for a list of component portfolios.
This portfolio list may be explicit or derived.   An  IndexAccount  is
defined  as an account whose holdings are created starting with a list
of securities and one or more rules to derive a <i>shares owned</i> value.
<p>

Messages that apply to all Account subclasses are defined at  Account.
Messages   that   address   the   unique  requirements  of  Portfolio,
AggAccount, and IndexAccount instances are defined at the  appropriate
subclass.  Your installation may define additional subclasses.
<p>

Instances of the Account classes are named at the lowest level  class.
For example, portfolio XYZ would be accessed using:
<pre><b>    Named Portfolio XYZ </b></pre>

An extra naming dictionary is defined at the Account  class  to  allow
interchangeable   access   among   the   classes.   For  example,  the
expression:
<pre><b>    Named Account XYZ </b></pre>

also returns portfolio XYZ.  If the same id  is  used  to  identify  a
portfolio and another account instance, the expression will return the
portfolio instance.  The property  <i>uniqueId</i>  is  used  to  create  a
unique identifier for each instance.  The expressions:
<pre><b>    Named Account P_XYZ = Named Portfolio XYZ

    Named Account A_XYZ = Named AggAccount XYZ </b></pre>

      and

<pre><b>    Named Account I_XYZ = Named IndexAccount XYZ </b></pre>

all return the value TRUE.

The message <i>locateId:</i> has been redefined at the Account class to use
the following search rule:

<ul type=disc>
<li>Named Account
<p>
<li>Named Portfolio
<p>
<li>Named AggAccount
<p>
<li>Named IndexAccount
</ul>
<p>

For example, the expression:

<pre><b>    Account locateId: "XYZ" </b></pre>

returns <i>Named Account XYZ</i> if it is  defined,  otherwise  it  returns
<i>Named  Portfolio  XYZ</i>,  otherwise  <i>Named AggAccount XYZ</i>, otherwise
<i>Named IndexAccount XYZ</i>, otherwise NA.
<p>

<a name="The Account Class"><h3>The Account Class</h3></a>

The class Account is used to unify all the protocol that is common  to
portfolios,   aggregates,   and  index  accounts.  The  following  key
properties are defined for all Accounts:
<p>

<center><table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><b>Property</b><td><b>Initial Value</b><td><b>Type</b>
<tr><td>code<td>Supplied String<td>String
<tr><td>name<td>code<td>String
<tr><td>uniqueId<td>{P,A,orI}_code<td>String
<tr><td>* baseCurrency<td>Named Currency US<td>Currency
<tr><td>* manager<td>Named Manager Default<td>Manager
</table></center>
<p>

<center>* Included in Account initialization list</center>
<p>

Each subclass of  Account  performs  its  own  unique  initializations
followed  by  general  account  initializations.   In  addition to the
specific   subclass   initializations   and   the   standard    Entity
initializations,  the  class Account performs the following steps when
you create a new instance of any subclass:

<dl>
<dt><dd>- The <i>uniqueId</i> for the instance is added to the  <i>Named  Account</i> dictionary.
<dt><dd>- The structures needed to support holdings data are initialized.
</dl>
<p>

All accounts respond to the message <i>holdings</i> by returning  the  list
of  Holding instances associated with the Account as of the evaluation
date.  Holdings-related messages are described in detail in <a href="invHolding.htm"><i>The Class Holding</i></a>.
<p>

Several properties are  precomputed  whenever  the  holdings  data  is
updated.  These values are retained over time.
<p>

<center><table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><b>Message</b><td><b>Returns</b>
<tr><td>*_totalCost<td>unadjusted total cost
<tr><td> totalCost<td>currency adjusted total cost
<tr><td>*_totalMarketValue<td>unadjusted total market value
<tr><td> totalMarketValue<td>currency adjusted total market value
<tr><td>*_totalMarketValueCash<td>unadjsuted mkt value (cash)
<tr><td> totalMarketValueCash<td>currency adjusted mkt value (cash)

<tr><td> totalMarketValueEquity<td>currency adjsuted mkt value (equity)
<tr><td>*_totalMarketValueFixed<td>unadjusted mkt value (fixed)
<tr><td> totalMarketValueFixed<td>currency adjsuted mkt value (fixed)
</table></center>
<p>

<center>* Indicates the property value </center>
<p>

The <i>profile</i> message can be used to display a summary description  of an Account:

<pre><b>    Named Account A_XYZ profile</b></pre>

produces:

<pre><b>    *** AggAccount Profile For: XYZ
    Code:                         XYZ
    Aliases:                      XYZ /

    ---  Links   ---

    totalMarketValue (US):                    NA</b></pre>

Additional messages defined at the Account class include:
<p>

<center><table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=8>

<a name="The Portfolio Class"><h3>The Portfolio Class</h3></a>

Instances of the class <b>Portfolio</b> correspond to portfolios  as  defined
by  the  accounting  system.   A  new  Portfolio  instance  is created
whenever a new portfolio is introduced by the production account feed.
<p>

The following key properties are defined for the class Portfolio:
<p>

<center><table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><b>Property</b><td><b>Initial Value</b><td><b>Type</b>
<tr><td>code<td>Supplied String<td>String
<tr><td>name<td>code<td>String
<tr><td>uniqueId<td>P_code<td>String
<tr><td>* baseCurrency<td>Named Currency US<td>Currency
<tr><td>* manager<td>Named Manager Default<td>Manager
<tr><td>aggregateList<td>empty list<td>IndexedList
</table></center>
<p>
<center>* Included in Portfolio initialization list</center>
<p>

In addition to the standard Entity and  Account  initializations,  the
class  Portfolio  performs  the  following steps when you create a new
instance:

<dl>
<dt><dd>-The <i>uniqueId</i> is created by appending the value of <i>code</i> to the
prefix <i>P_</i>.
<dt><dd>-The value of code is added the <i>Named Account</i> dictionary as well
  as the <i>Name Portfolio</i> dictionary.
<dt><dd>-The <i>aggregateList</i> property is initialized to an empty list.
</dl>
<p>
For example, the expression:
<p>
<pre><b>    Portfolio createInstance: "XYZ" .
    setNameTo: "Sample XYZ Portfolio" </b></pre>

creates a new Portfolio instance with a <i>code</i> of <i>XYZ</i>, a  <i>uniqueId</i>
of  <i>P_XYZ</i>, and the supplied name.  The <i>profile</i> message can be used
to display a summary description of this portfolio:
<p>
<pre><b>    Named Portfolio XYZ profile </b></pre>

produces:

<pre><b>    *** Portfolio Profile For: Sample XYZ Portfolio
    Code:                         XYZ
    Aliases:                      XYZ /

    ---  Links   ---
    baseCurrency :                US        US Dollars
    manager :                     Default   Default

    ---  XRefs  ---

    ---  Supplemental Data  ---
    uniqueId:                     P_XYZ
    holdings (count):                           0
    totalMarketValue (US):                    NA

    aggregateList (count):                      0 </b></pre>

Portfolios can be added and removed from  AggAccount  instances.   The
following  messages  are  used  to  manage  the relationship between a
Portfolio instance and the aggregates of which it is a member:
<p>

<center><table border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><b>Portfolio Message</b><td><b>Description</b>
<tr><td>addToAggregate: aggAcct<td>Adds recipient to supplied aggregate
<tr><td>aggregateList<td>IndexedList of aggregates that include this Portfolio
<tr><td>displayAggregateList<td>Displays the current list of aggregates that include this Portfolio
<tr><td>removeFromAggregate: aggAcct<td>Removes recipient from supplied aggregate
</table></center>
<p>

AggAccounts are described in more detail in the next section.
<p>

<hr>

<a name="The AggAccount Class"><h3>The AggAccount Class</h3></a>

Instances of the class <b>AggAccount</b> correspond to user defined groupings
of  portfolios.   A  new AggAccount instance and its portfolio members
can be defined via a feed from the accounting system or  interactively
using the messages described below.  A specific portfolio will only be
included  in  an  aggregate's  member  list  one  time.   The  message
<i>memberList</i>  returns  an  indexed  list  of  the portfolios currently
included in the aggregate's definition.
<p>

Several messages are  available  to  create  and  maintain  AggAccount
instances.  To create a new AggAccount, type the expression:

<pre><b>    AggAccount create: "code" fromPortfolioList: list </b></pre>

where code is name you wish to use to reference the AggAccount
and list is a list of portfolios to be used or a block defining a rule which returns a list of portfolios
when executed.
<p>

This message performs the following steps:

<ul type=circle>
<li>A new instance  is  created  using  the  supplied  code  and  the <i>uniqueId</i>  is  created by
appending the code value to the prefix <i>A_</i>.  The <i>memberList</i> property is initialized to an empty  list
and   all   standard   Account  and  Entity  initializations  are
performed.
<p>

<li>If the supplied portfolioList is a List, each member is added  to
the aggregate's memberList.
<p>

<li>If the supplied portfolioList is a  Block,  the  <i>membershipRule</i>
property is set to the block.
</ul>
<p>
For example:

<pre><b>    AggAccount create: "Test1"
        fromPortfolioList: (Named Portfolio XYZ, Named Portfolio ABC) ; </b></pre>

This message will create an AggAccount named Test1 with two  portfolio
members  (assuming  they exist).  The <i>profile</i> message can be used to
display a summary description of this aggregate:

<pre><b>    Named AggAccount Test1 profile </b></pre>

produces:

<pre><b>    *** AggAccount Profile For: Test1
    Code:                         Test1
    Aliases:                      Test1 /

    ---  Links   ---
    baseCurrency :                US        US Dollars
    manager :                     Default   Default

    ---  XRefs  ---

    ---  Supplemental Data  ---
    uniqueId:                     A_Test1
    holdings (count):                           0
    totalMarketValue (US):                    NA

    memberList (count):                         2 </b></pre>


To create an AggAccount using a rule instead of an explicit list,  you
supply  a  block that can be executed to produce a list of portfolios.
<p>

For example:


<pre><b>    AggAccount create: "Test2"
       fromPortfolioList: [ ^global Portfolio masterList ] ; </b></pre>

This message will create an AggAccount named Test2 and will update its
member list whenever you execute the <i>updateMemberships</i> message.  For
example, if there are currently 10 portfolio instances defined in your
database, the expression:

<pre><b>    Named AggAccount Test2 updateMemberships profile </b></pre>

produces:

<pre><b>    *** AggAccount Profile For: Test2
    Code:                         Test2
    Aliases:                      Test2 /

    ---  Links   ---
    baseCurrency :                US        US Dollars
    manager :                     Default   Default

    ---  XRefs  ---

    ---  Supplemental Data  ---
    uniqueId:                     A_Test2
    holdings (count):                           0
    totalMarketValue (US):                    NA

    memberList (count):                        10
    membershipRule:
    [ | membershipRule | ^global Portfolio masterList ] </b></pre>


To change the membership rule, use the <i>setMembershipRuleTo:</i> message.
For example:
<pre><b>    Named AggAccount Test2
      setMembershipRuleTo: [ ^global Portfolio activeList ] ; </b></pre>

By  default,  an  AggAccount  will  not   have   any   holdings.    To
automatically create the AggAccount and build the appropriate holdings
structures, use the form:

<pre><b>    AggAccount createAndInitialize: "Test" fromPortfolioList:
       (Named Portfolio XYZ, Named Portfolio ABC) ; </b></pre>

This  message  will  create  an  AggAccount  named  Test,  create  the
appropriate  holding  instances,  and  compute portfolio level summary
statistics.   Holdings  data  and  portfolio  summary  statistics  are
described more fully in <a href="invHolding.htm"><i>The Holding Class</i></a>.

To set the membership list to an  explicit  portfolio  list,  use  the
expression:

<pre><b>    Named AggAccount Test setPortfolioListTo:
      (Named Portfolio XYZ, Named Portfolio DEF) ; </b></pre>

To add a portfolio to this AggAccount, use the expression:

<pre><b>    Named AggAccount Test addPortfolio: Named Portfolio DEF ; </b></pre>

To delete a portfolio from the AggAccount, use:

<pre><b>    Named AggAccount Test deletePortfolio: Named Portfolio ABC ; </b></pre>

After you have added and/or deleted portfolios from an aggregate,  you
must rebuild its holdings-related data using the expression:

<pre><b>    Named AggAccount Test doPrecalcs </b></pre>

The precalcs are not done automatically so that you can add and delete
several portfolios quickly.
<p>

To display the current portfolios in this aggregate, use:

<pre><b>    Named AggAccount Test portfolioList
      do: [ code print: 10 ; name printNL ] ; </b></pre>

To determine which aggregates include a particular portfolio, use  the
expression:

<pre><b>    Named Portfolio XYZ displayAggregateList </b></pre>


This list will display all AggAccounts that include this Portfolio.
<p>

<hr>

<a name="The IndexAccount Class"><h3>The IndexAccount Class</h3></a>

Instances of the class IndexAccount correspond to user  defined  lists
of  securities  that  can be viewed as an Account.  A new IndexAccount
instance and its security  members  can  be  created  via  a  feed  or
interactively using the messages described below.  A specific security
will only be included in an index account's member list one time.  The
message  <i>memberList</i>  returns  an  indexed  list  of  the  securities
currently included in the index portfolio's definition.
<p>

To create a new IndexAccount and assign an initial list of securities,
type the expression:
<pre><b>    IndexAccount createInstance: "MyIndex" .
       setSecuritiesTo: (Named Security GM, Named Security IBM )
       asOf: earliestPossibleDate ; </b></pre>

This message  creates  a  new  IndexAccount  named  <i>MyIndex</i>  with  2
members.   The  member  list can be accessed via the <i>memberList</i> time
series which returns the list of security members as  of  the  current
evaluation  date.   The  <i>profile</i>  message  can  be used to display a
summary description of this aggregate:

<pre><b>    Named IndexAccount MyIndex profile </b></pre>

produces:

<pre><b>    *** IndexAccount Profile For: MyIndex
    Code:                         MyIndex
    Aliases:                      MyIndex /

    ---  Links   ---
    baseCurrency :                US        US Dollars
    manager :                     Default   Default

    ---  XRefs  ---

    ---  Supplemental Data  ---
    uniqueId:                     I_MyIndex
    holdings (count):                           0
    totalMarketValue (US):                    NA

    memberList (count):                         2 </b></pre>


To create the membership for an IndexAccount using a rule  instead  of
an explicit list, you supply a block that can be executed to produce a
list of securities.  For example:

<pre><b>    Named IndexAccount MyIndex
      setMembershipRuleTo:
      [ ^global Security masterList select: [ baseCurrency isUS ] ]; </b></pre>

The <i>getMembers</i> message returns the list of security members  for  an
IndexAccount  as  of  the  evaluation  date.   If a membership rule is
defined, the list is created using the rule; otherwise,  the  security
list  stored  in  the <i>memberList</i> time series is returned as a simple
List.   The   message   <i>updateMemberships</i>   actually   updates   the
<i>memberList</i>  property  as of the current evaluation date by using the
defined membership rule.
<p>

The message <i>addMember:</i> can be used to add a security to the  current
member list of the index as of the evaluation date.  For example:

<pre><b>    Named IndexAccount MyIndex addMember: Named Security IBM </b></pre>

adds this security to the most recent membership list for  this  index
if  it  is  not  already a member.  The message <i>deleteMember:</i> can be
used to delete a security from the current member list.
<p>

The message <i>getIndices</i> defined at the Security class returns a  list
of  IndexAccount  instances  that  include  that  security  as  of the
evaluation date.  For example, the expression:

<pre><b>    Named Security IBM getIndices
    do: [ code printNL ] ; </b></pre>

displays the list of IndexAccounts that include IBM as of  the  latest
membership update date.
<p>

The message <i>getMemberWeightsUsingAccount: account</i> is used to  extend
the  current  list  of  member  securities  by  their market value and
weights based on various weighting schemes.  The message  returns  the
member security list extended by the following messages:

<pre><b>    pctEvenDollar
    mvalEvenDollar
    pctMCapWeighted
    mvalMCapWeighted
    pctMValWeighted
    mvalMValWeighted </b></pre>


The  <i>MVal</i>-weighted  values  are  computed  using  the  corresponding
holding  in  the  supplied Account.  This value can be supplied as NA.
The <i>even dollar</i> technique assumes that $1,000 is  invested  in  each
security  in  the  index.  The <i>market cap weighted</i> technique assumes
you own all the outstanding shares in  the  security,  valued  at  the
current evaluation date's price.  If an account or valid account id is
supplied as a parameter to this message, the <i>market  value  weighted</i>
technique  assumes  that  you  own  the  same  number of shares in the
security that you own in the supplied account, valued at  the  current
evaluation date's price.
<p>

For example, the expression:

<pre><b>    Named IndexAccount MyIndex getMemberWeightsUsingAccount: NA .
    do: [ ticker print: 10 ;      #-  security ticker
          name print: 30 ;        #-  security name
          pctEvenDollar print ;   #-  %held if even dollar weighted
          pctMCapWeighted print ; #-  %held if mkt cap weighted
          newLine print ;
        ] ; </b></pre>

generates a report that  shows  the  <i>even  dollar</i>  and  <i>market  cap
weighted</i> percentages held for each security in the the IndexAccount.
<p>

Several messages  have  been  defined  to  generate  holdings  for  an
IndexAccount  using  various  rules  for  generated  ownership.  These
messages include:

<pre><b>    createEvenDollarHoldingsAsOf:
    createEvenShareHoldingsAsOf:
    createMCapWeightedHoldingsAsOf:
    createMValWeightedHoldingsAsOf:using:
    setSharesIn:to: </b></pre>

These messages are describe in detail in <a href="invHolding.htm"><i>The Holding Class</i></a>.
<p>

<hr>

<a name="New Instances and Additional Messages"><h3>New Instances and Additional Messages</h3></a>

Account instances are usually created and  maintained  as  part  of  a
nightly  production  cycle.   The  specific processing rules used vary
based on your installation's policies.  
<p>

Your installation may have defined many additional  messages  for  the
various Account classes.  The <i>showMessages</i> message is the fastest
way to determine the current list of messages available for  a  class.
For example:

<pre><b>    Portfolio showMessages </b></pre>

displays the messages defined for the Portfolio class and

<pre><b>    Portfolio showMessagesX </b></pre>

displays the messages  defined  for  Portfolio  and  its  superclasses
Account and Entity.
