The <a href="admTools.htm#Garbage Collection"><i>garbage collection</i></a>
and <a href="admTools.htm#compaction"><i>compaction</i></a> tools 
can be used to eliminate structures from your Vision database network that 
are no longer active.  There are some structures associated with 
property values and methods that are not automatically purged 
by these tools.  Several messages have been defined that allow 
you to flag additional information for the garbage collector to free.
<p>

Vision properties and collections manage internal structures for 
each type (i.e.,  class) of value stored for any of its instances. 
Vision properties and lists retain references to types even after 
none of the instances they represent refer to values of the type.  
To support the selective deletion of unneeded references, two 
primitives are available: the <i>cleanStore</i> message operates 
on the instances of a class and the <i>cleanDictionary</i> message 
operates on the message dictionary of a class. Both messages are defined 
at the class <i>Object</i> and return a <i>Boolean</i> value indicating whether 
the recipient object was "cleaned".  The cover methods <i>rcleanStore</i>
and <i>rcleanDictionary</i> can be used to recursively clean the stores 
or dictionaries of the recipient object.  The messages <i>cleanStoreAndDictionary</i> 
and <i>rcleanStoreAndDictionary</i> can be used to perform both types of  
clean up for the recipient object.  
<p>

The <i>cleanStore</i> message can be sent to a class to eliminate any unneeded 
references for its properties.  For properties that reference instances of 
other user-defined classes, an alignment operation is also performed if 
necessary.  The alignment operation replaces a chain of pointers with a single 
pointer in cases where the referenced class has had additions or deletions 
since the last time the property was updated, thereby speeding up access.  
The <i>cleanStore</i> message should also be explicitly sent to any properties 
that reference collections to align these structures as well.  
For example, if Security defines a fixed property <i>heldList</i> that contains 
a list of <i>Holding</i> instances, you would use:
<pre>
	mySecurity heldList cleanStore
</pre>

to align the list as well as to purge old, non-referenced 
structures.  If values of <i>heldList</i> are clustered for all securities, 
you only need to run <i>cleanStore</i> for one element.  If the values of 
<i>heldList</i> are not clustered, you could use:
<pre>
	Security instanceList do: [ heldList cleanStore ] ;
</pre>

The message <i>cleanDictionary</i> is the class level analog of <i>cleanStore</i>.  
It aligns the class dictionary and purges unneeded <i>define:toBe:</i> and 
<i>defineMethod:</i> definitions.
<p>

It is useful to periodically clean the stores and dictionaries for each 
class in your database.  For most classes, this simply involves executing 
the <i>cleanStoreAndDictionary</i> message.  Classes that contain property 
values which reference lists of elements need to also execute the <i>cleanStore</i> 
message on any of these properties as well.  Also, any class that manages multiple 
clusters (i.e., parallel stores created using the <i>newPrototype</i> message) must 
explicitly send the cleanStore message to each of these clusters.
<p>

The message <i>cleanupClassStructures</i> has been defined at the class 
<i>Object</i> to perform the basic <i>cleanStoreAndDictionary</i> operation 
on the recipient and display a confirmation if the recipient required cleaning.  
This message can be redefined for any class that requires additional steps.  
For example, to redefine this message to also clean the <i>heldList</i> property 
at <i>Security</i>, use:
<pre>
	Security
	defineMethod:
	[ | cleanupClassStructures |
	  ^super cleanupClassStructures ;      #-- runs the general version
	  heldList cleanStore
	      ifTrue: [ "-- cleaned Security heldList" printNL ] ;
	  ^self
	] ;
</pre>

<h2 id="deletions">Deletions</h2>

<h4 id="ObjectDeletion">Object Deletion</h4>

Instances can be flagged for deletion without actually removing the 
object from the database.  This is the recommended approach for most 
applications, giving you an opportunity to undelete an accidental 
deletion if necessary.  Several properties have been defined at <i>Object</i> 
to aid in tracking deletion information.  Undeleted objects have values 
of NA for all of these properties:
<pre>
     Property	      Definition</pre>
<ul><hr width=450 align=middle></ul>
<pre>     deletionFlag     TRUE if flagged for deletion
     deletionDate     Date object was flagged for deletion
     deletionReason   String explaining deletion reason
</pre></b>
The expression:
<pre>
	object flagForDeletionWithReason: string

        where object	is the object to be flagged for deletion
	string	        is the reason for deletion
</pre></b>

is used to flag an object for deletion.  It is defined to perform 
the following operations:

<ol type="1">
<li>Set the value of <i>deletionFlag</i> to TRUE.
<p>
<li>Set the value of <i>deletionDate</i> to the current date.
<p>
<li>Set the value of <i>deletionReason</i> to the supplied string.
<p>
<li>Run the object's implementation of the method <i>cleanupDeletedObject</i>.
</ol>

The <i>cleanupDeletedObject</i> message executes the following steps:

<ol type="1">
<li>Run the object's version of <i>cleanupLocalAttributes</i>.  By default, 
this message does not do anything.  It should be redefined as 
appropriate for specific classes.
<p>
<li>Run the object's version of <i>cleanupLocalNames</i>.  By default,  
this message deletes the object's code from the class' naming dictionary, 
if one exists.  This message can be redefined or augmented at specific 
classes as needed.
</ol>

Several messages have been defined to utilize the <i>deletionFlag</i> property:

<pre>
     Message	  Definition</pre>	
<ul><hr width=380 align=middle></ul>
<pre>     isActive     TRUE if object's deletionFlag isNA
     isntActive   TRUE if object isActive != TRUE
     isDeleted	  Same as isntActive
     isntDeleted  Same as isActive
</pre>

The message <i>activeList</i> is used to return all instances 
of a class (as base objects) that are active and not default.
<p>

To actually delete an object from the database, you need to send the  
<i>delete</i> or <i>rdelete</i> (recursive delete) message to it.  The recursive 
version should normally be used, since it deletes the instance of the object at all levels of its inheritance path.
<p>

Note that objects should be deleted with care.  If you delete 
any object that is referenced by another object (e.g., as the value of a property), 
the reference will be replaced by a reference to the <i>Null</i>
or <a href="Classes.htm#shadow"><i>Shadow</i></a> instance for the deleted 
object's class.  As a result, the old reference will continue to respond 
to the same messages; however, all properties of the <i>Shadow</i> instance 
will contain NA values.  You cannot assign values into the properties of the 
<i>Shadow</i> instance.  To determine if an object is the Shadow instance,
you can send it the <i>isInternalDefault</i> message.

<h4 id="MessageDeletion">Message Deletion</h4>

Messages should be deleted using the <i>deleteMessage:</i> message.  
The general form for message deletion is:
<pre>
	object deleteMessage: "message"
</pre>

<h4 id="OtherDeletions">Other Deletions</h4>

The <i>delete:</i> message can be used to remove a point from a time series, 
an indexed list, or a dictionary object.  For example:
<pre>
	Named Security delete: "IBM"
</pre>

deletes the name IBM from the <i>Security</i> class' naming dictionary.  
The general forms of this message are:

<pre>        dictionary delete: string

	where	<i>dictionary</i> is an instance of the <i>Dictionary</i> class
	and	<i>string</i> is an instance of the <i>String</i> class

	ts delete: date

	where	<i>ts</i> is an instance of the <i>TimeSeries</i> class
	and	<i>date</i> is an instance of the <i>Date class</i>

	ilist delete: object

	where	<i>ilist</i> is an instance of the <i>IndexedList</i> class
	and	<i>object</i> is an object that was used as an index in this list
</pre>

<h2 id="SchemaMessageManagement">Schema Message Management</h2>

The class <i>Schema MessageImplementationDescriptor</i> maintains information 
about the messages in your Vision database.  Each message defined for any class 
in the schema database has a corresponding instance in this class.  These instances 
store information about the message itself including its type, function, and description, 
as well as tracking changes to methods over time.
<p>

All classes created using a variation of the <i>createSubclass</i> message will 
automatically be available in the database. New instances of the 
<i>Schema MessageImplementationDescriptor</i> class are NOT  
created automatically.  Each time you use one of the <i>define</i> messages, 
the class is flagged to indicate that new messages are pending.  To process 
and refresh all messages, execute the expression:

<pre>
	Schema processAllMessages
</pre>

This process creates and refreshes message descriptors in the 
schema database as needed.  It will generate a report similar 
to the one illustrated below:

This report displays the status of the schema database prior 
to processing, the list of classes processed, the status after 
processing, and the number of messages created and refreshed.
Depending on the number of classes to process, the update time 
will range from a few seconds to a few minutes.  Most installations 
incorporate this procedure into a standard nightly update.
