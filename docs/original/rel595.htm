<h3 id=description>Description</h3><p>

This document outlines the changes made in Vision release 5.9.5.  This
release contains a number of miscellaneous cleanups to various executables
and new and corrected methods for the core classes and some tool kits.
<br><br>
<table width=92%><tr align=left valign=top><td>IMPORTANT:  <td>Solaris users must have installed Patch-ID# 103612-33 for SunOS 5.5.1 prior to running the 5.9.5 version of batchvision.</table>
The release includes the following two top-level directory trees:<br>
<ul type=disc>vision.5.9.5
<br>rel.5.9.5
</ul type=disc>
The <i>vision.5.9.5</i> directory is the latest version and contains all executables
and standard scripts.  The executables can be copied to your <i>/vision</i> directory
when the release is to be promoted into production.  A comparison of this
release's vision directory with your on-site directory will indicate which
other files may have been changed or deleted.  It is left to the Administrator
to make the site-specific <i>/vision</i> directory compatible with the latest version.
You should expect to find changes to the following executables:<br><br>

<ul type=disc><pre><b>/vision/bin/batchvision
/vision/bin/format
/vision/bin/loadtape
/vision/bin/paginate

/vision/dbs/compustat2
/vision/dbs/inc.
/vision/dbs/normalize
/vision/dbs/preproc2
/vision/dbs/shuffle
/vision/dbs/transpose
/vision/dbs/valueline

/vision/tools/checksum
/vision/tools/<i>dbconvert</i>
/vision/tools/makemvscript
/vision/tools/ndftool
/vision/tools/onck
/vision/tools/onprof
/vision/tools/rollback
/vision/tools/viewndf
/vision/tools/viewseg
/vision/tools/vquery
/vision/tools/xndfosds</b></pre></ul>

The <i>rel.5.9.5</i> directory contains Vision protocol that is specific to this
release and modifications or additions to existing administrative procedures.
From this directory, the script <i>Install</i> can be used to install the necessary
scripts and update the Schema.  It assumes the scripts are located in the
<i>rel5.9.5</i> directory and reads in <i>install.5.9.5</i> which installs the following
files containing Vision code:
<ul type=disc><table width=80%>
<tr valign=top align=left><td>FIXcore.5.9.5   <td>Modified protocol for core classes
  <tr valign=top align=left><td>EXTcore.5.9.5   <td>New protocol for core classes

  <tr valign=top align=left><td>CHadmin.5.9.5   <td>New and modified protocol for the AdminTools ToolKit
  <tr valign=top align=left><td>CHov.5.9.5      <td>New and modified protocol for the OpenVision ToolKit

  <tr valign=top align=left><td>CHschema.5.9.5  <td>New and modified protocol for the Schema ToolKit
  <tr valign=top align=left><td>CHiface.5.9.5   <td>New and modified protocol for Interface and FormatTools
 </table> </ul>
The <i>EXTcore</i>, <i>CHadmin</i>, and <i>CHov</i> scripts include protocol that will only work with release 5.9.5.  The other scripts contain protocol that will work with earlier releases, but have been incorporated into the standard Vision bootstrap as of this release.<p>
</ul>
</ul>

<b><hr id=genaccesstoGRM>Generalized access to Global Reclamation Manager (GRM) -- 
    HPUX only.</b>

<ol type=1>
<li>Moved GRM implementation from the <i>ps</i> module in batchvision into
	the <i>VkMemory</i> module, so that all executables we build that map
	memory can participate in the Global Reclamation Management.<p>

<li>Made participation in the GRM the default behavior.<p>

<li>Can explicitly turn off participation by setting the 
<i>VisionGRMEnabled</i> environment variable to '0'.<p>

<li> Added a <i><i>syslog</i></i> interface for the GRM. Currently three categories
	of information are logged:<p>

<ul type=disc><li>Starting of the <i><i>dbconvert</i></i> server <i>(LOG_INFO)</i>
<li>Starting of any executable which can participate in the GRM but elects not to. <i>(LOG_INFO)</i>
<li>Failure to map a file <i>(LOG_WARNING)</i>
</ul><p>
	See the main page for <i>syslogd(1M)</i> for a general explanation of
	the <i>syslog</i> facility. The executables listed in the next
	section can be configured to log to a number of different
	facilities -- <i>local0, local1, local2, local3, local4, local5,
	local6, local7, daemon</i>. For most of the executables the means
	of configuration is the environment variable
	<i>VisionGRMlogFacility</i>. In the case of <i>dbconvert</i>, a command line
	option (-l) is also provided. <i>dbconvert</i> cannot rely on the
	environment being properly initialized when it is invoked in
	server mode via the <i>inetd.conf</i> file.<p>

<li>Participating executables:<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>batchvision
<li>checksum
<li>dbconvert
<li>inc.
<li>onprof/onck
<li>shuffle
<li>transpose</ul><p>

<li>Defined new environment variable for activating GRM traces
	VisionGRMTrace.  The default is no tracing. <p>

GRM traces previously enabled by the environment variable <i>VisionNetOpenTrace</i> and by the debugger expression, '<i>#M segmentScanTrace on</i>' are now enabled by this new variable only.<p>

</ol>
<b><hr id=addofRSp>Addition of RestartSession primitive<p> </b>

    Utility define:'<i>restartSession</i>'<i> toBe: 3 asPrimitive</i>;<p>

    Running this primitive will replace the current session with a
    fresh session started with the same options as the original. The
    pid will be the same. The input and output channels will be the
    same. All uncommitted modifications will be lost. Because the NDF
    will be reread, the latest version of the network will be
    accessed after this primitive is executed (unless batchvision was
    invoked with the <i>-v</i> option. In that case, the same version of the
    object network will be accessed.)<p>

    This definition is included as part of the <i>CHcore.5.9.5</i> script.<p>


<b><hr id=addtoOVC>Addition of <i>TCP_NODELAY</i> option to OpenVision Channels
</b><p>

    This release exposes the <i>TCP_NODELAY</i> flag for OpenVision socket
    channels. In previous releases <i>TCP_NODELAY</i> was hardcoded to be
    off. In certain uses (e.g. numerous short messages being sent
    between a client and server) setting <i>TCP_NODELAY</i> can improve
    performance. The default value for the flag is to be off.
<p>
    <i>TCP_NODELAY</i> can be turned on via an option in the specification
    string used at channel creation or via a message sent to the
    channel after it has been created.
<p>
    By including the '<i>n</i>' character in the option portion of the
    specification string, a service or stream channel can be created
    with <i>TCP_NODELAY</i> turned on. For other types of open vision
    channels (e.g. files), the '<i>n</i>' option is silently ignored.
<ul type=disc><b><pre>!nd_spec    <- "inet/stream,pn:9004";
!nd_service <- nd_spec asOpenVisionChannel; </pre></b></ul>
    Alternatively, the channel could be created in the usual way, and
    the 'turnTCPNoDelayOn' message can be used to set the <i>TCP_NODELAY</i>
    flag. 
<ul type=disc><b><pre>!nd_spec    <- "inet/stream,p:9004";
!nd_service <- nd_spec asOpenVisionChannel;
nd_service turnTCPNoDelayOn; </pre></b></ul>
    To turn <i>TCP_NODELAY</i> off,
<ul type=disc><b><pre> nd_service turnTCPNoDelayOff; </pre></b></ul>
    Or to query the setting (zero indicates off; non-zero, on):
<ul type=disc><b><pre> !noDelaySetting <- nd_service tcpNoDelay;
</pre></b></ul>
    Message definitions and changes are included as part of the
    <i>CHov.5.9.5</i> script.
<p>
<b>
<hr id=bugfix>Bug Fix: (Identity vs. Scalar)</b><p>
      [] send:[^self = asSelf]<p><p>

<b><hr id=resolveBusError>Resolve Bus Error occurring at OpenDialog startup. <p> 
</b>
    The 5.9.4 build for the HPUX9 platform could not run the
    OpenDialog package   ...    5.9.5 can.<p>

<b><hr id=reimplRebuild>Reimplementation of the Rebuild function</b><p>
	

    The old Rebuild feature of batchvision would create an NDF from an
    object space directory. This is a useful feature in that it allows
    recovery from the case of a deleted or corrupted NDF file. The
    ability to make a new NDF turns out to have another practical
    use. Over time, the NDF can grow quite large and rebuilding it to
    contain only the latest version provides a means of managing the
    size of the NDF.<p>

    A fair amount of care was required to use this feature. Any segments
    present in an object space which might have been leftover from a
    previous rollback would result in the rebuilt NDF containing an
    inconsistent view of the network. This inconvenience is a
    necessary one when recovering from a corrupted NDF, but is an
    unnecessary nuisance when simply trying to manage NDF size.
<p>
    A second shortcoming of the previous rebuild implementation is
    that it neglected to record segment information in the
    NDF. Utilities such as <i>dbconvert</i> make use of the segment
    information and can't run if it is not present. Therefore, on a
    system where <i>dbconvert</i> is being used to replicate the object
    network, the old rebuilder could not be used.<p>

    A final problem with the previous implementation was the obsolete,
    currently meaningless timestamp parameter which was required as
    input.<p>

    The new rebuilder operates in two modes. It can create an NDF
    given an object space directory, as before. It can also create a
    single version NDF given an already existing NDF. The first mode
    would be used to recover from the case of a corrupted or lost NDF.
    The second mode would be used to manage the size of the NDF. The
    NDF output by either mode will contain the segment information
    required by the <i>dbconvert</i> utility.<p>

    The value following the -R option now refers to the rebuild mode.
    Valid values are <i>fromOSD</i> and <i>fromNDF</i>.  To invoke the Rebuilder in
    the first mode, use the following command line:<p>

<ul type=disc><b><pre>batchvision -R fromOSD -o &lt;OSD Path Name&gt; -n &lt;NDF Path Name&gt;
</b></pre></ul>

    The -o option can be omitted if the environment variable,
    <i>OSDPathName</i>, has been set. The -n option can be omitted if the
    environment variable, <i>NDFPathName</i>, has been set, or if the default
    value, <i>/vision/network/NDF</i> is desired.<p>

    This mode will create a new NDF as specified using the object
    spaces found in the Object Space Directory (OSD) as specified.
    If a file by the same name as &lt;NDF Path Name&gt; exists, it is first
    removed and then replaced by the rebuilt NDF.<p>

    To invoke the Rebuilder in the second mode, use the following
    command line:

       <ul type=disc><pre><b>batchvision -R fromNDF -n &lt;NDF Path Name&gt;</b></pre></ul>

    The -n option can be omitted if the environment variable,
    <i>NDFPathName</i>, has been set, or if the default value,
    <i>/vision/network/NDF</i> is desired.<p>

    Invoked this way, the rebuilder simply writes out the latest
    version contained in &lt;NDF Path Name&gt; to a new file: &lt;NDF Path
    Name&gt;.new . If &lt;NDF Path Name&gt;.new already exists, it is first
    removed.<p>

    By specifying the -v option to batchvision, a version other than
    the latest version can be chosen. This provides an alternative to
    the rollback utility.<p>


<b><hr id=segVerification>Segment Verification<p></b>

    Beginning with this release, batchvision and <i>onprof/onck</i> will
    verify that a segment belongs to the NDF which is pointing to
    it. On occasion, an NDF has been copied to provide access to a
    particular version of a network without having to use the <i>-v</i>
    option. If someone using such a copied NDF updates the network, it
    is likely that an existing segment created via the original NDF
    will be overwritten. The network as described by the original NDF
    is therefore corrupted. This feature will catch this error early,
    and identify it via an explicit error message.<p>


<b><hr id=cleanupAA>Cleanup / Alignment augmentation<p></b>

    This release builds on the container table based cleanup strategy
    introduced in release 5.9.4.<p>

    Several omissions have been discovered and closed.
    Two new methods have been added to the <i>AdminTools</i> ObjectSpace
    class. These are <i>cleanDictionaries</i> and <i>cleanDescriptors</i>. They
    are implemented in terms of two new primitives added to the
    <i>AdminTools _POP</i> class -- <i>cleanDictionaryViaPOP</i> and
    <i>cleanDescriptorViaPOP</i>.  These POP based cleaners have been added
    because not all descriptors and dictionaries are accessible for
    cleanup via Vision objects. <i>cleanDictionaries</i> and
    <i>cleanDescriptors</i> have been added to the <i>AdminTools</i> ObjectSpace
    <i>cleanSpace</i> method. In addition, the <i>cleanTables</i> method has been
    modified so that it no longer cleans dictionaries.<p>

    Message definitions and changes are included as part of the
    <i>CHadmin.5.9.5</i> script.<p>


<b><hr id=comp2Updates>Compustat2 updates<p></b>

    The <i>compustat2</i> data base update utility has been modified to use
    the EBCDIC flag in the layout file header (line 1, field 4). If the
    flag is set, compustat2 converts from EBCDIC to ASCII. If the flag
    is 0, no conversion is performed. In prior releases, compustat2
    ignored the EBCDIC flag and always performed the EBCDIC to ASCII
    conversion.<p>

    <i>compustat2</i> also has been modified to deal correctly with industrial
    annual tapes that contain header records. <p>

<b><hr id=NDFMapping>NDF Mapping Coherency on HP (<i>dbconvert</i>)</b><p>

    A problem was noticed under HPUX where <i>dbconvert</i> would attempt to
    use an out-of-date version of the NDF which was mapped into
    memory, even though the current version existed on disk. This
    release forces <i>dbconvert</i> to discard any previously mapped version
    and use the latest version found on disk.
<p>
    General documentation about the <i>dbconvert</i> utility has been added
    to the insytenet web site under the <a href=admTools.htm>Administration/Tools</a> section.
<p>
<b><hr id=removalofObsolete>Removal of obsolete tools.
</b><p>
    Starting with the 5.9.5 Release, the following tools are no longer
    included in the build.
<ul type=disc><b><pre>- checkseg5.7 / fixseg5.7
- copyndf
- makeomitlist
- xndfvts</pre></b></ul>
<p>
<b><hr id=onck>Onck/onprof updates
</b><p>
    <i>onck</i> and <i>onprof</i> are now links to the same executable, the
    difference between them being that <i>onprof</i> presents RTYPE
    statistics whereas <i>onck</i> does not.
<p>
    In addition, because error messages sometimes get lost in the
    volume of output, these programs now print an explicit <i>pass/fail</i>
    message upon exit.
<p>
<b><hr id=aixPlatform>The AIX platform has been built using the C++ compiler.
</b><p>
<b><hr id=vqueryupdate>vquery update
</b><p>
    A number of changes have been made to the vquery program.  Some of
    these were released in the web site version prior to 5.9.5 but are
    redocumented here for completeness.
<p>
<ol type=1>
<li>Error messages are now generated in HTML format so your
       browser can display them.

<li>vquery no longer goes into an infinite loop when a Vision server
       is not available to process a request (no more run-away vquery's).


<li>The default class referenced by vquery has changed from the
       earliest release.

       The default class and message now executed by vquery is:
    
<ul type=disc><pre><b>Interface HtmlAccess
get: "url-path"
usingQuery: "url-query"
for: "client-host-name"
at: "client-host-address" ;</b></pre>
</ul>
       Earlier versions were defined to use the UserInterface HyperWS class.
       You have the ability to override the default class in the <i>vquery.cfg</i>
       file.  The recipient Vision class can be overridden for all 
       destinations in a configuration file using the <i>default class</i> 
       directive.  The recipient Vision class can be overridden for a 
       specific destination using the <i>class <dest></i> directive.  The 
       following example illustrates both:

<ul type=disc><pre><b>default class   UserInterface HyperWS

server default  pugsley:7001
server test     pugsley:8010

server demo     pugsley:7200
class  demo     Interface HtmlAccess</b></pre>
</ul>
       As expected, when both a class <i><dest></i> directive and a <i>default class</i>
       directive are present in the same file, the <i>class <dest></i> directive
       overrides the <i>default class</i> directive for the destination to which it
       applies. When multiple servers are created to handle a destination, the
       same class specification applies to all of the them.  For example, the
       <i>class analyzer</i> statement in the following example:

<ul type=disc><pre><b>server analyzer pugsley:7010
server analyzer lurch:7010
class  analyzer UserInterface HyperWS</b></pre>
</ul>
       applies to both <i>analyzer</i> servers.

<p>
<li>vquery source code is available on Web.
<p>
       The entire source for the vquery program resides in a single file
       which is available on our web site under the <a href=ifDownload.htm>Interface/Downloads</a>
       section for users who wish to modify it for their own purposes.
       Instructions for compiling it on different systems are supplied at
       the top of <i>vquery.cpp</i>.
<p>
<li>The default expression sent to Vision can be modified.
</b><p></ol>

       The default expression sent to Vision can now be specified as an
       option in the <i>vquery.cfg</i> file.  The syntax used to specify that
       expression includes the ability to substitute the values of any or
       all environment variables as well as certain other information.  
<p>
       Two new commands have been added to the set of commands recognized in a
       <i>vquery.cfg</i> file.  The command:

<ul type=disc><pre><b>default expression aVisionExpressionSpecification</b></pre>
</ul>
       establishes a Vision expression to use by default for any service
       destination that does not supply its own specification.  Any service
       that requires a different expression can override the default expression
       using the directive:

<ul type=disc><pre><b>expression aServiceName aVisionExpressionSpecification</b></pre>
</ul>
       Both the <i>default expression</i> and <i>expression</i> directives must be
       included on a single input line.  THERE IS NO PROVISION FOR ESCAPING 
       A LONG EXPRESSION ACROSS MULTIPLE LINES.
<p>
       If a <i>default expression</i> directive does not appear in a <i>vquery.cfg</i>
       file, vquery behaves as if the following default expression were
       supplied:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>default expression $$class get: $$path usingQuery: $$query for:
$REMOTE_HOST at: $REMOTE_ADDR</b></pre>
</ul>
       This default <i>default expression</i> specifies the expression that vquery
       has historically generated.  In particular, it specifies that the
       message <i>get:usingQuery:for:at:</i> be sent to the class specified by the
       <i>class</i> directive for the service.  The parameters to that message are
       obtained by substituting data available from vquery's environment.
<p>
       The substitution rules are straightforward.  Except for the <i>$$class</i>
       substitution, all substitutions are formatted as Vision strings with
       embedded <i>"</i> and <i>\</i> characters suitably quoted to keep Vision happy.  All
       substitutions begin with a <i>$</i> followed by a symbol that names an
       environment variable or special substitution.   A substitution that
       begins with a single <i>$</i> is assumed to name an environment variable.  
       If the environment variable exists, its value is substituted as a string
       into the expression generated and sent to Vision.  The <i>$REMOTE_HOST</i>
       and <i>$REMOTE_ADDR</i> substitutions above are examples of environment
       variable substitutions.  If the environment variable does not exist, an
       empty string is substituted.  As vquery is currently implemented, there
       is no way to distinguish between a non-existent environment variable and
       one that is defined to have an empty value.
<p>
       In addition to environment variable substitution, vquery recognizes four
       special substitutions:
<p>
<ul type=disc><li><i>$$class</i>  - substitute the class specified by the <i>default class</i> or
           <i>class</i> directive applicable to the service.  In the absence
           of either, <i>Interface HtmlAccess</i> is assumed.  The <i>$$class</i>
           substitution is the only substitution that is NOT formatted 
           as a string in the expression generated and sent to Vision.
<p>
        <li><i>$$path</i>   - substitute the part of the URL path left after vquery has
           stripped it of its service name and/or address component.
<p>
        <li><i>$$query</i>  - substitute the form input data supplied as part of the
           request.  Because different form request methods use different 
           mechanisms for passing form data, this substitution should be 
           used instead of the <i>$QUERY_STRING</i> environment variable substitution
           to obtain form input data.
<p>
        <li><i>$$environment</i> - substitute the entire set of environment variable
           bindings available to vquery.  Each environment variable is 
           supplied one per line in the form <i>name=value</i>.
</ul><p>



<b><hr id=containerTableOverflow>Container Table Overflow checking</b>
<p>
    An infinitely recursive Vision method can result in filling up
    all available slots in the container table for the scratch pad space.
    In earlier versions, the result of a container table overflow was
    undefined, usually some sort of <i>Read-Eval-Print</i> error. This version
    includes an explicit check for container table overflow, and generates
    a <i>Read-Eval-Print</i> error if overflow would occur. On most systems,
    the infinitely recursive Vision method would run into a malloc error
    before container table overflow would occur.
<p>
<b><hr id=internalgarbage>Internal transient garbage collection modified.</b>
<p>
    The algorithm to reclaim unreferenced <i>PToken</i> chains was changed
    from recursive to iterative. The same change was applied to the
    reclamation of virtual machine fragments. If either chain was long
    enough, an internal run-time stack overflow could occur.
<p>
<b><hr id=solarisonly>Solaris only:  Segmentation Faults and Bus Error Signals generate
    a stack dump.</b>
<p>
    A stack dump is generated in the current working directory with a
    name of the form:  <i>pstack.ppp.n</i>  where <i>ppp</i> is the process id of the
    batchvision session, and <i>n</i> is a counter which is incremented by each
    stack dump generated by that session.

<p>    This behavior can be disabled by setting an environment variable prior
    to starting the vision session:

<ul type=disc><pre><b>setenv VisionStackDump 0</b></pre>
</ul>
    Setting this variable to any non-zero numeric value, or 
<ul type=disc><pre><b>unsetenv VisionStackDump</b></pre>
</ul>
    will turn stack dumping back on for subsequent invocations of batchvision.
<p>
<b><hr id=visionAddressThreshold>VisionAddressThreshold environment variable</b>
<p>
    This variable is used to influence when a segment reclamation scan
    is done. If a map segment operation returns a process address less
    than this threshold, a reclamation is attempted.  This variable
    applies primarily to the Solaris platform.  Its purpose is to
    reserve the address space lower than the threshold for private
    memory allocation. Judicious use of this tuning parameter can help
    an application avoid a memory allocation error. The default value
    for this variable is zero, meaning that, by default, this
    threshold will trigger no rescans. If the value is set too high,
    there will be a performance impact, but if a scan of the segments
    does not yield enough address space, the segment will be mapped
    below the threshold. For example, if the value is set to
    <i>0xf0000000</i>, a segment scan would be performed upon every segment
    access since, under Solaris, no segment can be mapped at an
    address higher than <i>0xf0000000</i>.<p>

<b><hr id=environVariables>Environmental Variables that accept Octal Input</b><p>The following environment variables now accept octal or hexadecimal
    input. In earlier releases, only decimal input was valid. Octal
    values are denoted with a leading '0'. Hexadecimal values are
    denoted with a leading <i>0x</i> or <i>0X</i>.

<b><hr id=persistentGarbageCollector>Persistent Garbage Collector</b><p>The persistent garbage collector (<i>Utility collectGarbage</i>) now
    rebuilds the container table free list in the opposite direction
    so that lower table indices are allocated first. This anticipates
    a feature in a future release that will allow container tables to
    be reduced in size.

<b><pre>********************
   FIXcore.5.9.5
********************</pre></b>

This script contains messages that have been modified in the core classes as 
part of release 5.9.5.

<b><pre>Class     Number
Message   pctChangeTo:</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message has been modified to correctly deal with negative values.
When the recipient and the parameter are of different signs, the value
<i>NA</i> is returned by this method.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Collection
Message   collectListElementsFrom: block</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message has been modified to correctly deal with parameters that
return lists when evaluated.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Object
Message   createIncorporatorClass:</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message has been modified to explicitly define the <i>currentStore</i>
constant to refer to the new class.

</ul>
<b><pre>********************
   EXTcore.5.9.5
********************</pre></b>
This script contains messages that have been added to the core classes as 
part of release 5.9.5.

<pre><b>Class     Object
Message   ifDefault: object</b></pre><ul type=disc>

If the recipient is the default object, this message returns the parameter,
otherwise the recipient is returned.  If the parameter is a block, it is
evaluated.

</ul><pre><b>Class     Object
Message   ifDefault: block1 else: block2</b></pre><ul type=disc>

If the recipient is the default object, block1 is sent to it; otherwise,
block2 is sent to it.  This can be used to eliminate some conditional
testing.  For example:
 
    <ul type=disc><b><pre>date ifDefault: [ "initial" ] else: [ formatUsingShortName ]</pre></b></ul> 

replaces:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>date isDefault
ifTrue: [ "initial" ] ifFalse: [ date formatUsingShortName ] </pre></b></ul>

</ul><b><pre>
Class     String
Message   convertToCaseInsensitiveRegEx</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message converts the recipient into a string that can be used
for case insensitive string matches with messages such as <i>contains:</i>.
For example:
     <ul type=disc><b><pre>"app" convertToCaseInsensitiveRegEx</pre></b></ul>
returns the string <i>[Aa][Pp][Pp]</i>.  The expression:
     <ul type=disc><b><pre>"Apple" contains: "app"</pre></b></ul>
returns FALSE.  The expression:
     <ul type=disc><b><pre>"Apple" contains: "app" convertToCaseInsensitiveRegEx</pre></b></ul>
returns TRUE.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Utility
Message   restartSession</pre></b>
<ul type=disc> Running this primitive will replace the current session with a
fresh session started with the same options as the original. The
process id will be the same. The input and output channels will be the
same. All uncommitted modifications will be lost. Because the NDF
will be reread, the latest version of the network will be
accessed after this primitive is executed, unless batchvision was
invoked with the <i>-v</i> option. In that case, the same version of the
object network will be accessed.  

Note that this message will not work with releases prior to 5.9.5.

<b><pre>********************
   CHadmin.5.9.5
********************</b></pre>
This script contains modifications and additions related to the <i>AdminTools</i>
ToolKit and cannot be installed in releases prior to release 5.9.5.

<b><pre>Class     AdminTools _POP
Message   cleanDictionaryViaPOP
          cleanDescriptorViaPOP</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These POP based cleaners have been added because not all descriptors
and dictionaries are accessible for cleanup via Vision objects.  

</ul><b><pre>Class     AdminTools ClusterType
Message   isDictionary
          isDescriptor</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These messages have been added as new inquiries for ClusterType
objects.

</ul><b><pre>Class     AdminTools ObjectSpace
Message   cleanDictionaries</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This new method cleans up dictionary objects as part of the <i>cleanSpace
</i> method.

</ul><b><pre>Class     AdminTools ObjectSpace
Message   cleanDescriptors</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This new method cleans up descriptors as part of the <i>cleanSpace</i>
method.

</ul><b><pre>Class     AdminTools ObjectSpace
Message   cleanSpace</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This method has been modified to include dictionary and descriptor
cleanups.

</ul><b><pre>Class     AdminTools ObjectSpace
Message   cleanTables</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This method has been modified so that it no longer cleans dictionaries.




</ul><pre><b>********************
   CHov.5.9.5
********************</b></pre>

This script contains modifications and additions related to the OpenVision
ToolKit and requires release 5.9.5.

<b><pre>Class     OpenVisionConstant
Message   nameInstances:</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This method has been modified so that it uses <i>\\?</i> instead of <i>?</i>
as the parameter to the <i>contains:</i> method so it works correctly
on NT and Unix.  The old version does not work correctly with NT.




</ul><pre><b>********************
   CHschema.5.9.5
********************</b></pre>

This script contains modifications and additions related to the <i>Schema</i>
ToolKit added as a supplement to release 5.9.5.  These changes assume that
this ToolKit has been installed.  

<b><pre>Class     Schema MID
Message   cleanupDeletedObject</pre></b><ul type=disc>

A step was added to clear the default value from an MID flagged for
deletion so that it is removed from the initialization list for the
class.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Schema CD
Message   clearDefaultValueUsing: mid</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This method has been modified so the recursive call correctly walks
through <i>childList;</i> it had been skipping the <i>childList</i> step.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Schema
Message   setDefaultValueOf:at:to: </pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message has been modified to use the correct property type when
installing a default for the first time; it had been hard-coded to
<i>FixedProperty</i>.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Schema MID
Message   setDefaultValueTo:</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message has been modified to use the correct property type;
it had been hard-coded to <i>FixedProperty</i>.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Object
Message   initializeDefaults</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This method has been modified so that it no longer initializes
properties that already have a non-NA value.  Prior to this,
properties initialized by <i>initializeKeys:</i> would be reset by
this message if the property was in the default initialization list.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Object
Message   showMessageSummaryFor:</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message has been modified to expand the message display width 
to the size of the largest message so that long message names are
not truncated.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Schema CD
Message   showInheritance</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message has been modified to show a single hierarchy instead
of dividing the output across different class descriptor types.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Schema CD
Message   getMessagesReturningClass</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This is a new message that returns the list of active MIDs defined
to return this class or any of its subclasses.

</ul><b><pre>Class     Schema CD
Message   getMessagesReturningSuperClass</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This is a new message that returns the list of active MIDs defined
to return a superclass of this class.  Messages that return the recipient
class or the Object class are excluded from this list.




</ul><pre><b>********************
   CHiface.5.9.5
********************</b></pre>

This script contains modifications and additions related to the
<i>Interface</i> and <i>FormatTools</i> ToolKits added as a supplement to release
5.9.5.  These changes assume that these ToolKits have been installed.
The web site documents have been updated to reflect these changes.  
<p>
Summary of major changes:
<p><ol type=1>
<li>Internal Reorganization of <i>FormatTools</i> class name
<p>
The class <i>FormatTools</i> was originally defined as the name of a class
at <i>CoreWorkspace</i> and the method at Object that selects the correct
context if redefined at <i>^local;</i> this led to incorrect behavior when
<i>FormatTools</i> was directly referenced since the version at <i>^global</i>
would bypass the version at <i>^local;</i> these changes remove this
inconsistency:
<p>
<li>Special characters changed to/from the appropriate hex codes
<p>
A number of changes have been installed to support the correct
encoding and decoding of strings that will be passed through a
cgi-bin program such as vquery.
<p>
<li>Modified and new formatting messages
<p>
The following <i>FormatTools</i> messages have been modified:
<ul type=disc><li>buildSectionBreakOver: span alignedTo: align
<ul type=square>span can now be supplied as a string containing %</ul>
<li>buildImage: file withPath: path withAlt: alt
<ul type=square>added border=0 (Html version only)</ul>
</ul><p>
The following <i>FormatTools</i> messages have been added:
<ul type=disc><li>buildImage: file
<ul type=square>builds image with no alternative name</ul>
<li>blankFill: n
<ul type=square>creates a string of 'n' non-breaking spaces</ul>
<li>font: f inSize: s andColor: c for: text
<ul type=square>surrounds 'text' in a font tag using supplied font, size,
       color (Html version) </ul>
<li>indent: text
<ul type=square>indents each line of text 5 additional spaces (non-Html)
<br>surrounds text by &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; tags (Html version)</ul>
<li>startParagraph
<ul type=square>new line (non-Html)
<br>&lt;p&gt; (Html version)</ul>
<li>startLine
<ul type=square>new line (non-Html)
&lt;br&gt; (Html version)</ul>
<li>buildAnchor: anchor withLabel: label
<ul type=square>creates an anchor tag from the inputs (Html version)</ul>
<li>buildScriptFrom: text
<ul type=square>surrounds text by script tags (Html version)</ul>
<li>buildOnClick: function withLabel: label
<ul type=square>creates a local href anchor that invokes the supplied
        function when the reference is "clicked"; the function
        should be written in the scripting language appropriate
        for your installation (Html version)</ul>
<li>encodeNewLinesIn: text
<br><li>decodeNewLinesIn: text
<ul type=square>preserves the new lines in a block of output by converting
        to/from a control character (^V) (Html version)</ul></ul>
<p>
<li>New sample Interface applications
<p>
The methods <i>GetValue, EntityHelper</i>, and <i>Profile</i> have been modifed
at Interface ApplicationWS as follows:
<p>
<i>EntityHelper</i>
<ul type=disc><li>remove call to java script
<li>use case insensitive searches
<li>add extra criteria tests</ul>
<p>
Profile
<ul type=disc><li>use supplied id as class name instead of <i>whatAmI</i></ul>
<p>
GetValue
<ul type=disc><li>path fixed to substitute "" on NA
<li>list output expanded</ul>
<p>
<li>Modification to Interface Global currency
<p>
The code used to set the Global currency for Interface-based applications
has been modified to allow the default to imply the local currency, instead
of <i>Named Currency Default</i>.
