<h3 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
On January 1, 1999, eleven countries are scheduled to begin using
 the <i>euro</i> as their currency.  Daily exchange rates from
the <i>euro</i> currency into <i>US dollars</i> will be available
from that date forward.  Fixed conversion rates for the eleven
countries will be established to aid in restating historical data 
for analysis purposes.  
<p>
The standard methods included with all
Vision installations are well-suited to handle the introduction of
the <i>euro</i>, which will behave like any other currency in the future.
Some minor modifications to the existing methods are needed to support
historical analysis.  There is no absolute correct way to accomplish
this.  The remainder of this document describes the issues and poses
some basic solutions which are simple to implement and will provide
consistent views of the data.  These changes can be installed as is
or can serve as a guide to designing your own solution.

<p><hr>
<h3 id="euroDef">Defining the Euro Currency</h2>
<p>
The <i>euro</i> is simply another instance of currency.  It will
normally be created as part of your standard currency or exchange
rate processing with the ISO code of <i>EUR</i>.
As of January 1, 1999, daily exchange rates between 
the <i>euro</i> and the <i>US dollar</i> should be supplied as part
of your daily exchange rate feed.  Just like any other currency,
this value will be stored in
the time series <i>usExchange</i> for the <i>EUR</i> currency instance.

<p><hr>
<h3 id="euroHistory">Historical Analysis</h2>
<p>
Most of the issues involved with using the <i>euro</i> relate to
viewing data that existed prior to its introduction.  Since there will be no
"official" exchange rate history for the <i>euro</i> prior to 1/1/99,
what is the "correct" way to present this information if the user
asks to see the data in currency <i>EUR</i>? Four possibilities exist:
<p>
<ol>
<li>return <i>NA</i> indicating that the data cannot be expressed
in currency <i>EUR</i>
<li>return the data in its reported currency
<li>apply the fixed euro conversion rate for the country
<li>apply a floating synthetic rate
</ol>
<p>
The first two of these cases can be handled by setting the appropriate
initial value in the <i>usExchange</i> time series for currency <i>EUR</i>.
If you want to return the value <i>NA</i> prior to 1/1/99, make sure
you have no value (or the value <i>NA</i>) stored prior to this date.
Many Vision installations initialize the time series to return <i>1.0</i>.
If this is the case, you should either delete this value or reset
the initial value to <i>NA</i>.  If you want to return the value in
its reported currency, the value of <i>1.0</i> should be stored
in this time series as of the initial date.  This will result in
the reported value (in its reported currency) being multiplied by
a currency factor of <i>1.0</i>, which is the equivalent of returning
the reported value in its reported currency for dates prior to the
introduction of the <i>euro</i> exchange rate.
<p>
Alternative 3, applying a fixed
conversion rate for pre-euro data, involves defining
an additional property, <i>fixedRateToEuro</i> at the <b>Currency</b>
class to store the fixed euro conversion rate for each participating
country.  A second property, <i>fixedEuroRateEnabled</i> can be enabled
or disabled to control whether you want this rate applied by default
or on demand.
The <i>exchangeTo:relativeTo:</i> method at <b>Currency</b>
requires modification to use this rate when converting to the
<i>EUR</i> currency on a date prior to daily exchange rate availability.
<p>
The final option, using a daily synthetic rate, can be implemented
by creating an additional <b>Currency</b> instance and populating
its <i>usExchange</i> time series with a daily synthetic rate, both
historically and into the future.
<p>
Implementation changes needed to support these approaches
are <a href="#visionCode">described later in this document</a>.

<p><hr>
<h3 id="legacy">Using the Legacy Currency</h2>
<p>
Many Vision installations
want to change the default currency for securities and companies
in participating countries to the <i>euro</i> so that data is accessed 
and displayed in this new currency by default.  This can be accomplished
by setting the <i>baseCurrency</i> property for these entities to
the currency <i>EUR</i>.  By default, data stored in <b>DataRecord</b>
and <b>DataSet</b> instances associated with these entities
will automatically be converted from the reported currency and
displayed in <i>euros</i>.  For example, assume the following:
<p>
<ul><ul>
<li>GermanSec has a price of 100 DEM on 12/31/98
<li>GermanSec's base currency is set to EUR 
<li>The fixed conversion rate from DEM to EUR is 2
</ul></ul>
<p>
The Vision expression:<pre>
     981231 evaluate: [ Named Security GermanSec price] </pre>
will return the value of 50 <i>euros</i>, since price data is
automatically converted from reported currency to the security's
base currency.  
<p>
Prior to changing the base currency to <i>EUR</i>, you will probably want 
to keep a reference to the legacy currency.  We recommend adding a new
property, <i>_legacyCurrency</i> to store this value for entities
that are being changed to the <i>euro</i>.  The cover method
<i>legacyCurrency</i> returns this currency if set, the base currency
otherwise.
<p>
If desired, a new currency, <i>LEGACY</i>, can be introduced to support
the Vision expression:<pre>
     Named Currency LEGACY evaluate:
       [ securityList do: [ ] ;
       ] ;
</pre>
This usage instructs Vision to display the data for each security
in the list using its legacy currency.  A minor change to
the <i>currency</i> method will be needed to support this.
These changes 
are <a href="#visionCode">described later in this document</a>.

<p><hr>
<h3 id="entityData">Monetary Data Stored at Entity</h2>
<p>
If you decide to reassign the <i>baseCurrency</i> to <i>EUR</i>
for securities and companies in participating countries and you
store monetary data in properties directly for these entities,
one final issue will need to be addressed.  
For these entity classes,
the <i>baseCurrency</i> value has been performing two distinct
roles:
<p>
<ol>
<li>the default currency in which to access and display
any data associated with the entity
<li>the currency in which data stored directly with the entity has
been reported.
</ol>
Monetary data is usually stored in <b>DataRecord</b> or <b>DataSet</b>
instances in which a distinct currency can be recorded.  When you store
monetary data in properties defined at <b>Security</b>, you are assuming
that the <i>baseCurrency</i> will not change and always reflects the
reported currency.  
<p>
One tempting approach is to just change <i>baseCurrency</i> to a 
time series property for the <b>Entity</b> class, storing the legacy
currency as of 1/1/1 and the <i>euro</i> as of 1/1/99.  This would
enable you to easily determine the correct reported currency; however,
it would cause inconsistent default behavior when using data
over time.  By default,
data accessed prior to 1/1/99 would be in the legacy
currency and data accessed after this data would be in <i>euros</i>.
<p>
A better solution is to decouple the two uses of <i>baseCurrency</i>
for the <b>Entity</b> class.  The <i>baseCurrency</i> should continue
to serve as the default currency in which to display monetary data 
for the entity.  A minor modification to the <i>currencyFactor</i>
method will enable it to select the correct reported currency
based on the evaluation date.
These changes are <a href="#visionCode">described later in this document</a>.

<h3 id="visionCode">Suggested Vision Modifications</h2>
<p>
This section supplies the suggested Vision code patches to address
the introduction of the <i>euro</i>:
<p>
<h4>Summary of changes</h4>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Introduce EUR currency
<li>Reset initial exchange rate to NA (for euro or all)
<li>Add support for fixed rate conversion prior to euro daily exchange rate
<li>Flag participating countries with euro start date
<li>Add and populate legacy currency at Entity
<li>Add support for <i>Named Currency LEGACY</i>
<li>Add reported currency for monetary data stored directly at Entity
<li>Add synthetic euro currencies
</ol>
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>Note: </b>
This approach assumes that you continue to update the legacy currency
exchange rates after 1/1/99.  These rates will continue to provide
the Legacy to US exchange rate.  If your currency source does not 
provide these values, they can be computed and stored daily using
the calculation:<pre>legacy fixed rate to EUR * daily EUR to US rate
</pre>
</blockquote>

#  Vision Changes in support of Euro processing
##################################################

####################
#  1. Introduce EUR currency
#
#  Create the Euro if it does not exist.  Add a cover method
#     to make it easier to identify.  
####################

####################
#  2. Reset initial exchange rate to NA (for euro or all)
#
#  Modify behavior of all currencies that do not have exchange rates
#    prior to a certain date.  Currently, if no rate is available, the
#    exchange rate is returned as 1.0 which implies that the monetary
#    value will be displayed in its default (base) currency.   NA is
#    probably the better result so that there is no assumption that
#    the currency exchange has happened. 
#
#  For installations not wishing to change current behavior, the
#    value for the euro currency (EUR) should be set to NA as of 1/1/1:
#
#-->  uncomment the next line if initialize method is not changed
#-->  Named Currency EUR :usExchange asOf: 10101 put: NA :
#
####################

#--  reset all initial exchange rates to NA

#  3. Add support for fixed rate conversion prior to euro daily exchange rate
#
#  Add property to support fixed rate conversion for selected currencies;
