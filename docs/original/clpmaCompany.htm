<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>
The instances of the class <b>Company</b> 
represent the individual  corporate
entities  for which you track information.  Information maintained for
a company typically includes country, industry, sales, and earnings.
The  instances  of  the  class  <b>Security</b>  represent   the   individual
securities  issued by a company or equivalent entity such as the government.
A variety of security  types  exist  including cash,  common  and  preferred
stocks,  convertible and non-convertible bonds,  and put and call
options.  Data maintained for a  security  typically  includes  price,
dividend and shares/amount outstanding information.  Portfolios hold specific
amounts of one or more securities.  
<p>
The following subset of the class hierarchy displays the classes
directly related to <b>Company</b> and <b>Security</b>:

<h3 id="basic">Basic Access</h3>
<p>
The 
<a href="clDict.htm#named">naming dictionaries</a>
<b>Named Company</b> and <b>Named Security</b> are the primary
dictionaries for accessing individual company and security instances.
For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Company IBM
</b></tt></pre>
accesses the company representing the corporate entity IBM and:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security IBM
</b></tt></pre>
accesses the security representing the common stock IBM.
<p>

All company and security instances will have at least one identifier.
Unique identifiers are stored as
aliases in the <b>Named Company</b> and <b>Named Security</b> 
dictionaries.  By default, the value of the <i>code</i> 
property is used as the first alias created.
Additional aliases are usually created for security and company
access.  For domestic securities, the <i>cusip</i> and <i>ticker</i> are
normally defined as aliases.  For international securities, the
<i>sedol</i> is normally defined as an alias.  Any alias that is 
added for a security is automatically added as an alias for its
<a href="#company-security">associated company</a> as well.
<p>
To display all the aliases associated with a specific entity you can 
display the list of strings stored in the <i>aliases</i> property.  For
example, to see the aliases defined for the company IBM use:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Company IBM aliases do: [ printNL ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
More information about company and security identification schemes
is available in the document
<a href="pmaIssues.htm#ids"><i>Portfolio Management Application Issues</i></a>.
<p>
Securities and companies respond to all <b>Entity</b> and
<b>Object</b> messages such as <i>code</i>, <i>name</i>, and
<i>baseCurrency</i>.
The message <i>displayInfo</i>
has been redefined to display the <i>code</i>, <i>ticker</i>, and <i>name</i>
for <b>Security</b> and <b>Company</b>.
The message <i>profile</i> has also been redefined for these classes
to display additional information.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Company IBM displayInfo ;
</b></tt></pre>
displays a summary line of information about the company IBM and:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security IBM profile ;
</b></tt></pre>
displays key information about the security IBM.
<p>
The message <i>masterList</i>
can be used to return the list of non-default companies or
securities.  For example, to display the <i>code</i> and <i>name</i> for each
<b>Company</b> instance, use:<pre><tt><b>
     Company masterList
     do: [ code print: 10 ; 
           name printNL ;
         ] ;

</b></tt></pre>
To display the number of <b>Security</b> instances, use:<pre><tt><b>
     Security masterList count 

</b></tt></pre>
<p>
<h3 id="company-security">The Company-Security Connection</h3>
<p>
The security <i>IBM Common Stock</i> is a Vision object whose
properties include pricing, dividend, and split information.  This
object is distinct from the company <i>IBM</i> whose properties
include sales, earnings, and industry information.  Although
<b>Company</b>
and <b>Security</b> are distinct classes in the Vision hierarchy, there is
obviously a close relationship between related instances of the two
classes since most securities are associated with a specific company
and companies issue one or more securities.
<p>
When you refer to the price earnings ratio for a security,  you  are
really  asking  for  the  current price of the security divided by the
earnings per share for the corporate entity that issued the  security.
The  property  <i>company</i> is defined at 
<b>Security</b> to return the value of
the  company  associated  with  the  security.   The   actual   object
representing  the  company  is  returned.   For  example,  the  Vision
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security IBM company
</b></tt></pre>
returns the object representing the company IBM and the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security IBM company = Named Company IBM
</b></tt></pre>
yields the result TRUE.  Note that several  securities  may  have  the
same value for <i>company</i> since more than one security can be issued by a
single company entity.  By default,  the  value  of  <i>company</i>  for  a
security  is  the default company instance. Automated and manual rules
can be used to link a security to its "real" company instance.
<p>
When you refer to the price earnings ratio  for  a  company,  you  are
really  asking for the current price of the company's primary security
divided by the earnings per  share  for  the  company.   The  property
<i>primarySecurity</i>  is  defined  at <b>Company</b>
to return the value of the
security defined as the primary security for the company.  The  actual
object representing the security is returned.  For example, the Vision
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Company IBM primarySecurity 
</b></tt></pre>
returns the object representing IBM's common  stock  security  and  the
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Company IBM primarySecurity = Named Security IBM
</b></tt></pre>
yields the result TRUE.  Note that only one security can  be  assigned
as  the  <i>primarySecurity</i>  for  a  company.  By default, the value of
<i>primarySecurity</i> for a company  is  the  default  security  instance.
Automated and manual rules can be used to link a company to its "real"
primary security instance.
<p>
The <i>peRatio</i> method could therefore be defined for <b>Security</b>
and <b>Company</b> as follows:<pre><tt><b>
     Security defineMethod: [ | peRatio | 
          price / company eps
     ] ;
     Company defineMethod: [ | peRatio | 
          primarySecurity price / eps 
     ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
where <i>eps</i> would need to be defined as a
<b>Company</b> message that returns the company's
earnings per share.
<p>
The property <i>securityList</i> is defined at <b>Company</b> to
return the list of securities associated with a company. 
To look at the securities associated with a company, use:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Company IBM securityList
     do: [ displayInfo ] ;

</b></tt></pre>

<p>
Messages such as <i>industry</i> and <i>primarySecurity</i>
return an object of another entity class.  You can therefore navigate
to that object and request any of its information.  For example,
the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Company GM primarySecurity name
</b></tt></pre>
returns the name of GM's primary security and the expression:<pre><b>
     Named Company GM industry showMessages
</b></tt></pre>
displays the messages defined for the <b>Industry</b> class.
<p>
Company instances return instances of the
classes <b>Country</b>, <b>Industry</b>, and <b>Sector</b>
via the messages <i>country</i>, <i>industry</i>, and <i>sector</i>.
These classes are <a href="#related">described below</a>.
<p>
For general descriptions of all the <b>Company</b> messages, see the

<p>
Messages such as <i>securityType</i> and <i>company</i>
return an object of another entity class.  You can therefore navigate
to that object and request any of its information.  For example,
the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM company name
</b></tt></pre>
returns the name of GM's company and the expression:<pre><b>
     Named Security GM type showMessages
</b></tt></pre>
displays the messages defined for the <b>SecurityType</b> class.
<p>
Security instances return instances of the classes 
<b>SecurityType</b> and <b>AssetCategory</b>
via the message <i>type</i> and the expression <i>type assetCategory</i>
<a href="#related">described below</a>.
Messages that access pricing and dividend information 
such as <i>price</i> and <i>dividend</i> interact with the
<b>PriceRecord</b> and <b>DivRecord</b>, classes, also
<a href="#datarec">described below</a> .  Messages that are used to support
<a href="#splits">split adjustment</a> are also described later in
this document.
<p>
A number of messages are defined at <b>Security</b>
to return related <b>Account</b> and <b>Holding</b>
information.  These messages are described in the document
<a href="clpmaAccount.htm#secXRef">
<i>Vision Application Classes: The Account Classes</i></a>.
<p>
For general descriptions of all the <b>Security</b> messages, see the document
<a href="mpmaSecurity.htm"><i>Vision Application Messages: Security</i></a>.
A number of  messages have been defined to address 
security identification and the relationship
between a <b>Security</b> and its issuing company.
These messages are described in more detail in the document
<a href="pmaIssues.htm#ids"><i>Portfolio Management Application Issues</i></a>.

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3 id="datarec">Prices and Dividends </h3>
<p>
The instances of the class <b>PriceRecord</b> contain a single date's
pricing information for a specific <b>Security</b> instance.  The
time series property <i>pricingSeries</i> is used to manage the
relationship between <b>Security</b> instances and their <b>PriceRecord</b>
instances over time.  The instances of the class <b>DivRecord</b>
contains total cash dividends paid by a security for a single date.
The time series property <i>dividendSeries</i> is used to manage the
relationship between <b>Security</b> instances and their <b>DivRecord</b>
instances over time.  
<p>
The messages <i>price</i> and <i>volume</i> are
defined at <b>Security</b> to return the most recent closing price 
and trading volume for the security as of the current evaluation date
(i.e., <i>^date</i>).  The price and volume are adjusted for any splits
that have happened since the data was stored.  The price is returned
in the security's <i>baseCurrency</i> by default.  For example:  <pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM price
</b></tt></pre>
returns GM's latest price value in GM's base currency,<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM :price asOf: 9702 .
</b>or<b>
     9702 evaluate: [ Named Security GM price ] 
</b></tt></pre>
returns the latest price as of Feb 28, 1997 in GM's base currency, 
and<pre><tt><b>
    "CAN" asCurrency evaluate: [ Named Security GM  price ]
</b></tt></pre>
returns GM's latest price in Canadian dollars.  The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM volume
</b></tt></pre>
returns GM's latest trading volume and the expressions:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM :volume asOf: 9702 .
</b>or<b>
     9702 evaluate: [ Named Security GM volume ] 
</b></tt></pre>
returns the latest volume as of Feb 28, 1997.
<p>
All values are split-adjusted through the current date.  
<p>
The following messages are defined for the class <b>PriceRecord</b>:
<p>
<center><table width=80% border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=8>
<tr><th>Message <th>Return Class <th>Description

</table></center>      
<p>
To access a full price record as of a specific date, use the message
<i>getPriceRecord</i>.  For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM getPriceRecord
     do: [ price print ; _price printNL ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
displays the latest adjusted and unadjusted closing prices.
The expressions:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM :getPriceRecord asOf: 9709 .
       do: [ price print ; _price printNL ] ;
</b>and<b>     
     9709 evaluate: 
       [ Named Security GM getPriceRecord
             do: [ price print ; _price printNL ] ;
       ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
both display the latest adjusted and unadjusted closing prices as of
September 30, 1997.
<p>
The message <i>prices</i> returns a <b>TimeSeries</b> of all 
<b>PriceRecord</b> instances associated with a <b>Security</b>.
For example, to display the adjusted and unadjusted prices
and volumes for all points in GM's time series, you could use:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM prices
     do: [ ^date print: 12 ;       #-- date in time series
           recordDate print: 12 ;  #-- date in record - should match
           price print ;           #-- adjusted value
           _price print ;          #-- unadjusted value
           volume print ;          #-- adjusted value

           currencyFactor print ;  #-- should be 1
           newLine print ;
         ] ;

</b></tt></pre>
Note that the <i>prices</i> message returns an actual time series
object so you need not prepend the ":"  to the message name.  
<p>
For general descriptions of all the 
<b>PriceRecord</b> messages, see the document
<a href="mpmaDataRecord.htm">
<i>Vision Application Messages: DataRecord</i></a>.
Special issues involved with managing the storage of pricing data
are described in the document
<a href="pmaIssues.htm#prices">
<i>Portfolio Management Application Issues</i></a>.

<p>
The message <i>dividend</i> is 
defined at <b>Security</b> to return the most recent cash dividend
for the security as of the current evaluation date
(i.e., <i>^date</i>).  The dividend is adjusted for any splits
that have happened since the data was stored and is returned
in the security's <i>baseCurrency</i> by default.  For example:  <pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM dividend
</b></tt></pre>
returns GM's latest dividend value in GM's base currency,<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM :dividend asOf: 9702 .
</b>or<b>
     9702 evaluate: [ Named Security GM dividend ] 
</b></tt></pre>
returns the latest dividend as of Feb 28, 1997 in GM's base currency, 
and<pre><tt><b>
    "CAN" asCurrency evaluate: [ Named Security GM dividend ]
</b></tt></pre>
returns GM's latest dividend in Canadian dollars.  
<p>
All values are split-adjusted through the current date.  
<p>
The following messages are defined for the class <b>DivRecord</b>:
<p>
<center><table width=80% border=1 cellspacing=2 cellpadding=8>
<tr><th>Message <th>Return Class <th>Description
<tr><td><i>_div</i><td>Number <td>actual cash dividend value provided

<tr><td><i>recordDate</i><td>Date <td>ex-date of dividend record 
<tr><td><i>security</i><td>Number <td> underlying security
</table></center>      
<p>
The message <i>dividends</i> returns a <b>TimeSeries</b> of all 
<b>DivRecord</b> instances associated with a <b>Security</b>.
For example, to display the adjusted and unadjusted dividend values
for each of GM's dividends, you could use:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM dividends
     do: [ ^date print: 12 ;       #-- date in time series
           recordDate print: 12 ;  #-- date in record - should match
           div print ;             #-- adjusted value
           _div print ;            #-- unadjusted value
           currencyFactor print ;  #-- should be 1
           newLine print ;
         ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
Note that the <i>dividends</i> message returns an actual time series
object so you need not prepend the ":"  to the message name.  
<p>
For general descriptions of all the 
<b>PriceRecord</b> messages, see the document
<a href="mpmaDataRecord.htm">
<i>Vision Application Messages: DataRecord</i></a>.

<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3 id="splits">Split Adjustments </h3>
<p>
To adjust per share data it is necessary to know what splits have
occurred between the date the data is known to be adjusted through
(adjustment date) and the current date.  To accomplish this, Vision
tracks splits for each security in a time series called
<i>rawSplitFactor</i>.  The actual factors are stored in this time series
as of their ex-date.  For example, if a 2-for-1 split in GM
Corporation occurred on January 15, 1995, the value 2 would be stored
in GM's <i>rawSplitFactor</i> as of this date.  
Vision tracks a second time series called <i>adjustmentFactor</i> that
represents the running product of these raw factors.  This variable has
an initial value of 1.  Each time a split occurs, a new point
representing the product of the new raw factor and the last
adjustment factor is stored in the adjustment factor as of the
ex-date.  
<p>
In general, methods have been created that automatically return
adjusted values by default.  For example, the
message <i>_price</i> is defined to return a <i>PriceRecord's</i> unadjusted
price (i.e., the original value) and the message <i>price</i> is defined
to return a <i>PriceRecord's</i> price adjusted for any splits.  
<p>
The split adjustment process is described in detail in the document
<a href="pmaIssues.htm#splits">
<i>Portfolio Management Application Issues</i></a>.

<hr>
<p>
<h3 id="updates">Updating Company and Security Data</h3>
<p>
The <b>Interface</b> class 
<a href="clDataFeed.htm"><b>ExternalFeedManager</b></a>
has been created to provide a 
uniform way to create and update any entity-related information.
<b>DataFeed</b> subclasses are defined to translate one or more
rows of information into the appropriate structures in your Vision
database.  Data can be supplied from a file, a spreadsheet,
a relational database, or any other table-based source.  You can 
also supply data directly as a string, using the tab character to
delimit columns and the carriage return to delimit rows.
<p>
Several <b>DataFeed</b> classes have been defined to load data for
<b>Company</b>, <b>Security</b>, and related classes:
<p><center><table border=1 width=80% cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2>

<p>
The property <i>memberList</i> has been defined at <b>Country</b> to
store the list of <b>Company</b> instances associated with each
<b>Country</b> instance.  You can manually update the member cross
reference using:<pre><tt><b>

Alternatively, you can use the
<a href="pma_CompanyToCountry.htm"><b>CompanyToCountry</b></a>
data feed which automatically updates the <i>country</i> property
at <b>Company</b> and cross references the <i>memberList</i> property

displays all the companies with a <i>country</i> value of <i>Great Britain</i>.
<p>
Note that you should use this feed instead of the <b>CompanyMaster</b> if you
want to cross reference the companies in the <i>memberList</i> property.
The <i>memberList</i> property is automatically updated when
you use the <b>CompanyToCountry</b> feed.  If you assign
values to the <i>country</i> property at <b>Company</b>
manually or using the <b>CompanyMaster</b> feed, these companies
will not be reflected in the country's <i>memberList</i>.
