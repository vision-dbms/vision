<h3>
<a NAME="tkInterface"></a>Vision Interface ToolKit</h3>
The Vision <b>Interface ToolKit</b> has been created to provide a set of
classes and messages that aid in interfacing with environments external
to Vision. This ToolKit enables you to standardize your interactions with
Vision and provides protocol for arbitrary expression evaluation, structured
data extraction, and parameterized queries.
<p>These classes assume that messages defined for built-in classes through
release 5.9.4 have been installed. These classes are installed as part
of the bootstrap for databases bootstrapped after March 1997.
<p>This interface includes the scripts needed to create the <b>Interface</b>
and <b>FormatTools</b> classes. The Vision script
<i>SETUP.iface</i> can
be used to load the other scripts and assumes that the files are all in
your current directory.

ToolKit Class: Interface</a></i> for more information.

<h3>
<a NAME="ifCAccess"></a>Sample C++ Interface Kit</h3>
The Vision C++ interface kit consists of a set of C++ classes that you
use to provide structured access to Vision data. The classes in this kit
provide you with array and character based access to Vision. This kit is
designed to interact with the
<a href="tkInterface.htm#extract"><b>ExtractWS</b>
class</a>.
<p>The Vision C++ interface kit is supplied in source code form. You are
encouraged to modify that source code to suit your needs.

Vision C++ Interface Kit</a></i>, for more information.

<h3>
<a NAME="ifVAccess"></a>The VAccess COM Objects</h3>
VAccess provides an in-process COM implementation of the capabilities provided
by the Vision C++ interface kit.
The objects implemented by VAccess use the capabilities of the Vision
<a href="tkInterface.htm#extract"><b>ExtractWS</b> class</a> to provide you with array and character based
access to Vision data.
<p>VAccess is available in both
<a href="download/VAccess.zip">executable</a> and
<a href="download/VAccess-src.zip">source</a> code form.

<p>See the document, <i><a href="ifVAccess.htm">The
VAccess COM Objects</a></i>, for more information.

<h3>
<a NAME="ifVLink"></a>The VLink OLE Server</h3>
VLink is an OLE Automation Server that provides access to Vision data from
Visual Basic 3.0, Visual Basic For Applications, and any other language
or package capable of using OLE Automation objects or calling a DLL.
<p>This interface is included as part of the Vision Application Client
software. Installation of the Vision Application Client software is automated
via the install program <i>VisionClient.exe</i>. The install program requires
the user to have Administrative Privileges for the current machine. This
setup needs connection information related to the Vision Application Server
which should be installed and operational prior to the Client setup. This
package also includes an Excel add-in that interfaces with the <a href="tkInterface.htm#extract"><b>ExtractWS</b>
class</a>.
<p><a href="download/VisionClient.exe">Click here</a>
to retrieve the
<i>VisionClient</i> installation application. You can put
this application anywhere on your local machine, then double click to start
the installation. Interactive instructions and notes are provided with
the installation. After the Vision Client setup is complete, you can <a href="admInstExcel.htm">install
the MS Excel Add-ins</a> that allow your client to extract information
from and upload information to your Vision database.
<p>Be aware that some of the options (Vision Administrator, VUpload.exe)
supplied by this installation may not be supported in older Vision installations
unless you have installed the appropriate patches.
<p>See the documents <i><a href="ifVLink.htm">The
VLink OLE Server</a></i> and
<i><a href="ifExcel.htm">Sample
Excel Access</a></i> for more information about these packages.
