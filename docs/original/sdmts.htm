<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The first generation of
database-centered applications -- maintaining an organization's operating
data -- demanded database management systems tuned to handle large numbers
of small, update-oriented transactions. The first generation of true
database management technology -- relational data base systems -- was well
matched to that class of problem. The normal forms of the relational model
taught many good lessons in data analysis and structuring, the large amounts
of simple data fit well into the tabular representation of relational data
base management, and for the most part, the relatively simple data in
these applications could be effectively queried using standard SQL query
languages.</p>

<p>As the complexity of database-centered applications grows, a new set
of database system requirements is emerging.  The new generation of
database-centered applications no longer focuses on operational data and transaction
processing. Instead, it focuses on:
<ul>
<li>managing and using complex relationships
<li>intelligent data acquisition
<li>decision support
</ul>
These new applications do not fit well into a relational
framework, primarily because relational database systems lack the ability
to express many of the constraints, rules, and queries these new applications
need.  When relational implementations are tried, large parts of the application
need to be written as custom programs in conventional programming languages,
not in the database system.

<p>This custom-programming strategy has significant costs in terms
of both performance and productivity. These costs are compounded by the
fact that many of these applications have a natural representation in the
new technology of object-orientation.  All of these factors have led to
the emergence of object-oriented databases -- a technology that unifies
the capabilities of database management and object-oriented programming
systems.</p>

<p>Merging these two technologies creates a new technology that is more
than the sum of its parts -- both in terms of the problems it can solve
and the technical demands it imposes on its implementation.  
Some attempts to create this new technology have begun with object-oriented programming
languages like C++ or Smalltalk, and
augmented them with database-like capabilities such as persistence and
sharing.

<p> Unfortunately, programming languages
and the techniques for optimizing them were never designed to scale to
the size of a very large database.  Other efforts started with relational
frameworks and attempted to generalize the representational and query processing
capabilities of these engines. While the set-orientation of a database
engine is required for the system to scale, the classic techniques for
optimizing and processing relational queries are not general enough to
be of value to the full range of queries possible in these much more powerful
information processing engines. To succeed, a new approach is required.</p>

<h2 id="Programming Languages Do Not Scale">Programming Language
Techniques Do Not Scale</h2>

<p>A solution to any problem that can be solved on a computer can be implemented
in a general purpose programming language.  Because the problems associated
with the new generation of database-centered applications require functionality
readily available in object-oriented programming languages but not present
in traditional relational query languages, it seems reasonable to start
with one of these programming languages and give it the database functionality
it lacks.  However, there are problems with this approach. </p>

<p>Traditionally, programming languages, including the current generation
of object-oriented programming languages, are designed to give programmers
precise control over the order in which programs execute.  The goal of a
programming language is the implementation of algorithms -- <i>how</i>
a result is obtained is as important as <i>what</i> result is obtained.</p>

<p>In contrast, database management systems attempt to frame requests in
terms of <i>what</i> result is required, leaving the complex issues of
<i>how</i> to obtain that result to the database system.  In its simplest
terms, even though a <i>SQL</i> query appears to be comparing every record
from one table with every record from another table to do a join, that
almost never happens in any well tuned, modern database system.  While
there are optimization techniques that rearrange programs to make them
more efficient, adherence to <i>how</i> constrains what can be done.</p>

<p>At its essence, the fundamental problem for any database system, including
an object-oriented database system, is the efficient processing of collection
operations.  Even though navigation reduces the need for some set-based
operations like <i>join</i>, every non-trivial application eventually needs
to select, group, or enumerate the elements of one of more collections.
Ultimately, the number and size of the collections in a database is the
issue that most impacts the scalability of the applications the database
supports. </p>

<p>The most serious problem with most languages is their failure to encapsulate
collection iteration in a useful way. Some languages are worse than others
in this regard.  For example, C++, despite its object-orientation, has no
constructs whatsoever for collection iteration.  Like its third generation
ancestor, C, it assumes that collection iteration is a special case
of the control flow iterators <i>for (...)...</i>,<i> while ...</i>, and
<i>do ... while (...)</i>.  Algorithmic in nature, the language provides
tools for precisely specifying <i>how</i> the iteration is to be performed,
not <i>what</i> the iteration is intended to do.</p>

<p> While object-orientation
makes possible the creation of a boundless number of collection types that
provide a rich set of collection organizations -- <i>Array</i>, <i>Bag</i>,
<i>Dictionary</i>, <i>TimeSeries</i>, and <i>Set</i>, among others -- programs
written using these collection types must ask for the elements of a collection
one at a time.  Even if a collection type implements manipulation methods
that accept element processing functions among their arguments, the issue
has merely been deferred -- these functions have no tools to examine either
the compiled code they were passed or the global context in which they
are executing in order to develop an efficient execution plan.</p>

<p>There are object-oriented languages, like Smalltalk, that do encapsulate
collection iteration.  These languages have taken a step in the right direction
in that they encourage a programming style that is less algorithmic and
more result-oriented.  Unfortunately, the standard implementations of these
languages still lack the architectural support to allow collections to
be treated as more than just a bundle of elements.  Just as in C++, there
are no tools, either explicitly available to the application designer or
implicitly built into the language processor, that allow collection operations
to examine the code they are executing or the global context in which they
are running.  Without that ability, it becomes very difficult to develop
query processing strategies that exploit the availability of storage structures
that optimize specific element level operations or that recognize redundant
patterns of access.</p>

<h2 id="Relational Query Engines Are Not General Enough">Relational
Query Engines Are Not General Enough</h2>

<p>If programming languages and their implementations lack a model for
result-oriented collection operations, that is certainly not true of relational
database systems. The design philosophy behind these systems is clearly
collection and result-oriented.  Even though it is possible to think of
queries algorithmically, <i>how</i> a result is obtained is usually determined
by the database system.  Not constrained by <i>how</i>, these systems are
free to find efficient, scalable answers to the question of <i>what</i>.</p>

<p>Naturally, this suggests that these systems ought to be the starting point
for object-oriented database technology. Unfortunately, there are problems
with this approach, as well.  To understand the problems, it is important
to understand how relational systems do what they do so well.</p>

<p>Relational database systems are specialists -- they restrict themselves
to a small set of well understood operations defined on a correspondingly
small set of basic types.  They achieve their performance by extensively
optimizing those operations.  Typically, what they understand are the logical
operations of <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, and <i>not</i> and the relational
operations of equality and inequality (i.e., &lt;, &lt;=, =, !=, &gt;=,
and &gt;) applied to numbers, strings, and a few simple variations on numbers
and strings like <i>Date</i>.  They achieve performance by constructing
indices that efficiently identify sets of records satisfying these relational
operations and by reordering queries to make the most efficient possible
use of those indices.</p>

<p>In a well designed database, most, if not all, queries
built using this restricted set of operations can be answered using these
high performance structures. Of course, not every field in the database
needs to be indexed and not every operation that the relational system
can do is optimized by an index.  In that case, most modern relational systems
attempt to bound the set of records that must be examined using the available
indices before reverting to the classical approach of actually iterating
through the remaining database records to obtain a final result.</p>

<p>While the query processing techniques of relational systems can be of
use in an object database, their value is limited.  While these techniques
can be helpful in cases where the system is called upon to identify a set
of records satisfying a criteria for which an index exists, the set of
operations that the object system is called upon to process far exceeds
the set of operations optimized by the multitude of tree structures used
to construct indices.  In those cases, a system naively constructed on top
of a relational engine finds itself falling through to the iterative technique-of-last-resort
that allows relational engines to process queries for which no better approach
can be found.</p>

<p>This problem is often compounded by the technique many hybrid systems
use to make new types and operations available from their query languages.
The approach taken by these systems uses a language like C++ to implement
new classes and operations.  These new types and operations are then treated
as a black box by the database system.  Instead of optimizing these new
types and operations as first class components of the database system,
the database system optimizes around them.  While this approach may eliminate
some of the data traffic between a database server and its clients, it
does nothing to optimize the new types and operations that are presumably
critical to the applications being developed with these systems.</p>

<h2 id="A New Paradigm For Data Base Programming">A New Paradigm
For Object-Oriented Database Implementation</h2>

<p>While object-oriented programming languages have the expressive power
to implement a new generation of database-centered applications, they
do not treat operations on collections as central to their architectures.
If a database management system is to be useful for more than simple record
retrieval, it must take a collection-centric view of its contents.  That
is well-established by the success relational systems have with the simple
queries and programs they are capable of expressing.</p>

<p>The techniques used
to implement these relational systems are too specialized, however, and must be generalized
to support the richer set of operations possible in object-oriented
databases.  That generalization is possible.  With it, a new collection-centered
architectural framework for object-oriented database programming emerges
with the scalability required to support the needs of large, analytic,
cross-sectional applications.</p>

<p>A collection-centric model is important to a database management system
because it allows both data and operations to be reorganized.  The single
most important reorganization in current systems involves the use of indices
to optimize the selection criteria used to locate one or more records in
a collection of records.  Even though current systems use collections and
indices as a way to optimize associative access, that is not the real reason
they are important in a generalized model.  They are important because they
provide an alternative physical structure that reduces the amount of unnecessary
data transferred from disk, where it is stored, to memory, where it can
be used.  When generalized, the principles they embody lead to the scalability
of a much broader class of operations. </p>

<p>Whether represented as a record, tuple, or object, an entity in the
world appears as a collection of related properties whose values hold the
modeled state of the entity.  This time-honored mapping makes intuitive
and mathematical sense and, almost universally, serves as the logical basis
for most database models of the world.  Typically, it serves as the physical
model for information storage as well.</p>

<p>A record, tuple, or object is usually
represented in memory as a contiguous block of fields holding values for
the entity it represents.  This holistic approach to physical representation
is not optimal for cross-sectional analyses of collections of entities.
Even though it exists as a whole, an entity is never used as a whole except
possibly when it is created or in response to the artificial question <i>&quot;Tell
me everything there is to know about...&quot;</i>.  This query is even more
artificial in the object world where <i>&quot;everything there is know&quot;</i>
can include navigations that ultimately access the entire database.</p>

<p>Instead,
entities are accessed and used one property at a time. Information in the
properties not being examined is simply ignored.  An index addresses that
by isolating the values of a specific property or set of properties from
a collection of entities.  When it uses an index, a database system accesses
just the values of the property it needs without transfering the values
of properties it has no intention of using.</p>

<p>Technically, an index represents a special case of a general concept
known as <i>vertical partitioning.</i>  When similar data objects are visualized
as a table, records store <i>horizontal</i> slices through that table while
indices store <i>vertical</i> slices. Even though the operations performed
in an object database are more complex than the operations traditionally
implemented using indices, the vertical partitioning principles remain
important. Access to the <i>sales</i> property for a collection of <i>Company</i>
objects can be far more efficient, especially for large collections, if
two conditions can be met:</p>

<ol>
<li>the physical model of the data base system can cluster the <i>sales</i>
property of those <i>Company</i> objects <i>vertically</i> so that they
are near each other on disk.</li>

<li>the computational model of the data base programming language can take
advantage of that clustering.</li>
</ol>

<p>Satisfying the first of these conditions -- the clustering condition
-- requires that the database system recognize that instances of a type
are created as part of a collection of related instances -- not simply
as independent objects that happen to have the same structure and behavior.
This is a broader definition than is traditionally employed by programming
languages.  In a programming language, types are used only for their
program-verification and code-generation capabilities and do not usually play a
role in managing the run-time environment.  Satisfying the clustering condition
is a relatively simple and localized problem of object memory management.
</p>

<p>Satisfying the second of these conditions -- the computational utility
condition -- is harder.  Satisfying this condition requires that collection
operations play an architecturally central role in the object database
programming language.  In particular, operations whose interpretation suggests
that they are enumerating the elements of a collection must be identified
and presented to the database engine for expansion, not implemented by
a program that doles out elements one at a time.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there is a natural way of interpreting the object model
that preserves its power while providing a framework for exploiting the
kinds of clustering needed to support high performance analytics.  Instead
of interpreting the properties of an object as fields in a structure, those
properties can be interpreted as <i>functions</i> that map one set of objects
-- the set of instances of the class where the properties are defined --
to other sets of objects -- the instances of other classes in the
database.  With this interpretation, the object database programming language
immediately elevates its perspective from individual objects to collections
of objects for everything that it does.</p>

<p>This change in interpretation comes without damaging the comprehensibility
of the database programming language. For example:</p>

<ul>
<p><i>gm sales</i></p>
</ul>

<p>is a perfectly natural, object-oriented way to ask for the value of
<i>gm</i>'s sales -- in fact, it is the expression that would be used in
a language like Smalltalk.  The change in perspective primarily occurs under
the covers of the database programming language.  From that perspective,
this expression applies the function <i>sales</i> to the collection of
objects returned from the function <i>gm</i>.  Presumably, <i>gm</i> is
a function defined in the user's current environment that returns the <i>Company</i>
object representing General Motors.  Standard object-oriented mechanisms
like inheritance remain applicable -- they are used as before to locate
<i>function</i> implementations based on the kinds of objects encountered.</p>

<p>Not all of an object's state is needed at once -- only <i>gm</i>'s <i>sales</i>
property is accessed from the hundreds, and in some cases, thousands of
properties typically needed to model a <i>Company</i> object.  That theme
is recurrent -- consider the expression:</p>

<ul>
<p><i>gm sales / gm industry sales *&nbsp;100</i></p>
</ul>

<p>which computes the percentage of <i>gm</i>'s sales relative to the sales
of its industry.  In this case only the values of <i>gm</i>'s <i>industry</i>
and <i>sales</i> properties are accessed. </p>

<p>If objects are accessed one at a time, it probably does not matter that
most of an object's properties are ignored.  It does matter when operations
are performed on collections of objects and it is not always obvious when
those operations are being performed.  Although this computation seems to
be a perfectly benign example of navigation, it uses a hidden collection.
This example is taken from a real database in which every <i>Industry</i>
object has a collection-valued property named <i>companyList</i> that records
the set of <i>Company</i> objects that comprise the <i>Industry</i>. Using
that list, <i>sales</i> is a derived property of <i>Industry</i> objects
computed using the expression:</p>

<ul>
<p><i>companyList total: [sales]</i></p>
</ul>

<p>Although this expression uses no relational operations or selection
criteria, it is still optimized by the vertical partitioning of <i>Company</i>
objects.  Although the database engine references multiple <i>Company</i>
objects to compute an industry's <i>sales</i>, it only requires the value
of one property -- <i>sales</i> -- from each of those objects.  The combination
of vertical object partitioning and the functional interpretation of objects
allows it to do just that without accessing information in properties that
are not being used. </p>

<p>Unlike relational systems which require that data be represented in
<i>first normal form</i> (i.e., no nested collections), the natural definition
of new object types requires the use and encapsulation of multi-valued
relationships.  As this example illustrates, the database programming language
must be prepared to deal with object properties that are themselves collections.
Among other things, that implies that the database programming language
must be prepared to deal with and optimize recursive collection operations.
For example:</p>

<ul>
<p><i>Company instances select: [sales &gt; industry sales * 0.4]</i></p>
</ul>

<p>is expected to return the set of companies whose <i>sales</i> is more
than 40% of their industry's <i>sales</i>.  As before, the set of properties
needed to process this expression is a small fraction of the total number
of properties available for <i>Company</i> objects.</p>

<p>Once again, there is
a natural functional interpretation for this query as the application of
the composed function <i>[sales &gt;&nbsp;industry sales * 0.4]</i> to
a set of <i>Company</i> objects.  In using that composed function, the
database engine first applies the functions <i>sales</i> and <i>industry</i>
to the set of <i>Company</i> objects passed to the <i>select:</i> operation
and then applies the functions <i>&gt;</i>, <i>sales</i>, and
<i>*</i> to the appropriate collection of objects returned from those initial
function applications.</p>

<p>The nested collection operation within the definition
of <i>industry sales</i> does not pose a problem and, in fact, presents an
opportunity for further optimization.  Unlike conventional object-oriented
programming systems that deal with collection enumerations one element
at a time, a functional perspective gives the database engine access to
the entire state of the query and thus gives it an opportunity to restate
the query in more optimal ways.</p>

<p>There are other benefits to vertical object partitioning and the functional
interpretation of objects.  One of them is data compression. The database
engine has the opportunity to build representations of properties optimized
to their data types and to compress those representations across multiple
instances.  As a result, it is possible to do things like compress null
values and object references across sets of instances and to design high
performance strategies for evaluating the composition of those compressed
functions.</p>

<p>The creation of a viable technology that uses these techniques is not
just an academic exercise.  The examples in this section are written using
the Vision<sup>TM</sup> database programming language from Innovative
Systems Techniques, Inc.  Vision
provides the logical modeling power and computational completeness of
an object-oriented programming language along with a collection-centric
perspective of database programming.  The first production databases and
applications built using Vision went into service in 1986
and remain in use today.  The collection-based storage and control flow
reorganization techniques described here have been part of Vision
since its introduction.</p>
