<h3 id=description>Description</h3>

<p>
Release 6.1.1 adds new capabilities, bug fixes, and specialized
performance improvements to Vision.  Internally, it also implements
many important architectural changes that lay the groundwork for
future capabilities.  These notes describe the functionality, bug
fixes, and other externally visible changes associated with this
release.  

<p>
Please note that this release introduces the need for a Vision license
key in order to update your database.  The license is tied to 
specific hosts or IP addresses.  Based on this information, Insyte
will supply you with a Vision script that must be installed in
order to update your database with release 6.1.1 (and future releases).
See <a href="#updatelicenses">Update Licenses</a> for more information.

<p>
Several Vision scripts have been included with this release,
providing optional new and modified messages for your installation:

<p>
<ul type=disc>
<table width=80%><tr valign=top align=left><td>EXTcore.6.1.1   <td>New protocol for core classes
<tr valign=top align=left><td>CHadmin.6.1.1   <td>New and modified protocol for the AdminTools ToolKit
<tr valign=top align=left><td>CHfeeds.6.1.1   <td>New and modified protocol for DataFeed support
</table></ul>


<p>
Some of these messages can be installed independent of the Vision
version being run; however, many of the messages included in this
release define new primitives which will only work with this and
future releases.  These messages are identified in the <a href="#newmessages">New Messages</a>.

<p>
<h3 id=updatelicenses>Update Licenses</h3>

<p>
A license issued by Innovative Systems Techniques, Inc. is required to
update a Vision database using this and subsequent Vision releases.
Without that license, Vision can be used to read an existing database
but not maintain or build one.  If, at the start of an update, Vision
cannot find a suitable license, it generates the following output:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>V> Utility updateNetwork
V> ?g
>>> License Does Not Permit Network Update From This Session &lt;&lt;&lt;
        5</pre></b></ul>

Vision update licenses are tied to specific hosts or IP addresses.
Once you have supplied Insyte with this information, you will receive via 
e-mail a Vision script containing licensing information defined for
your environment.  The EXTcore.6.1.1 script implements the basic
changes to the Utility class required to save and use the license.
With the modifications defined in those scripts installed, the Vision
license script you received simply needs to be run and saved once in order
to permanently enable updates to that database from the systems for
which you have licenses.

<h3 id=selectornotfound>Selector Not Found Reporting</h3>

<p>
As of this release, the information content of <i>Selector Not Found</i>
messages can be controlled via a session attribute.  The
EXTcore.6.1.1 script defines messages that enable and disable this
attribute.  When enabled, a display of the Vision virtual machine's
execution stack accompanies each <i>Selector Not Found</i> message.  By
default, this attribute is disabled, resulting in the generation of
conventional <i>Selector Not Found</i> messages.  The following example
illustrates the result of enabling this attribute:  

<ul type=disc><b><pre>####  Define a method that causes a selector not found, ...
V> Integer defineMethod: [ | foo | ^self bar ];
V> ?g

####  Generate the conventional selector not found, ...
V> 3 foo
V> ?g

>>> Selector 'bar' Not Found &lt;&lt;&lt;
      NA 

####  Enable verbose selector not found messages, ...
V> Utility SessionAttribute enableVerboseSelectorNotFound ;
V> ?g

####  And get the verbose message, ...
V> 3 foo
V> ?g

>>> Selector 'bar' Not Found &lt;&lt;&lt;

    Selector Recipient: #RTYPE_C_ValueStore[2:994]


----   1:

|foo|^self bar
           ^

----   2:

3 foo
  ^
      NA </pre></b></ul>

The <i>verboseSelectorNotFound</i> session attribute makes an experimental
capability added to release 5.9.5 controllable using a Vision expression.

<h3 id=stringtokenization>String Tokenization Primitives</h3>

<p>
Several new variants of the <i>breakOn:</i> primitive have been added to
Vision.  These are defined in the EXTcore.6.1.1 script and will only
work with release 6.1.1 and future releases.  These primitives extend
the <i>breakOn:</i> concept to support substring and pattern matching and
provide a convenient way to return both the matched and unmatched
portions of their input.  The following operations are available:  

<ul type=disc><b><pre>    Message             Index   Converse
    =======             =====   ========
    breakOn:            369     breakString:
    breakOnString:      389     stringBreak:		
    breakOnPattern:     390     patternBreak:

    tokenizeOn:         369/1   breakTokenize:
    tokenizeOnString:   389/1   stringTokenize:
    tokenizeOnPattern:  390/1   patternTokenize:

    cbreakOn:           370     cbreakString:
    ctokenizeOn:        370/1   cbreakTokenize:</pre></b></ul>

In this list, all but <i>breakOn:</i> and <i>cbreakOn:</i> and their converses
are new.

<p>
The <i>breakOn:</i>, <i>breakOnString:</i> and <i>breakOnPattern:</i> primitives
divide a string into one or more substrings based on a set of
characters, a string to be matched, or a regular expression,
respectively.  For example, if <i>s</i> is defined as:

    <ul type=disc><b><pre>!s &lt;- "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.";</pre></b></ul>

then, <i>s breakOn: "the". do: ["&lt;" print; print; ">" printNL];</i>
displays:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;T&gt;
&lt;&gt;
&lt; quick brown fox jump>
&lt;d ov>
&lt;r >
&lt;>
&lt;>
&lt; lazy dog.></pre></b></ul>

In this example, each occurrence of a "t", "h", or "e" marks the end of
a substring.  To match the string "the" exactly, <i>breakOnString:</i> is
used.  For example, using <i>breakOnString:</i> instead of <i>breakOn:</i> in
the previous example produces the following output:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;The quick brown fox jumped over >
&lt; lazy dog.></pre></b></ul>

Because <i>breakOnString:</i> performs an exact match, the initial "The"
wasn't used to delimit a substring.  To match on more complex
patterns, <i>breakOnPattern:</i> is used.  For example:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>s breakOnPattern: "[Tt]he".
do: ["&lt;" print; print; ">" printNL];</pre></b></ul>

displays:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;>
&lt; quick brown fox jumped over >
&lt; lazy dog.></pre></b></ul>

The <i>breakOn...:</i> operations return the text between matches as a list
of the form "substring-1", "substring-2", ..., "substring-n".  The
matched characters, strings, or patterns are not returned as part of
that list of substrings.  To deal with cases where the delimiting text
is of interest, the <i>tokenize...</i> primitives are provided.  These
primitives return their results as lists of the form "substring-1",
"match-1", "substring-2", "match-2", ..., "match-n-1", "substring-n".
For example, replacing <i>breakOn:</i> with <i>tokenizeOn:</i> in the first of
the preceding examples yields the output:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;T>
&lt;h>
&lt;>
&lt;e>
&lt; quick brown fox jump>
&lt;e>
&lt;d ov>
&lt;e>
&lt;r >
&lt;t>
&lt;>
&lt;h>
&lt;>
&lt;e>
&lt; lazy dog.></pre></b></ul>

Note that the elements in the output list returned by <i>tokenizeOn...</i>
always alternate between the substrings between matches and matched
text.  If matches occur at adjacent positions in the source string,
they are separated by an empty substring in the result.  The empty
substrings separating the matched "t"'s, "h"'s, and "e"'s are examples
of this behavior.  As is the case with <i>breakOn...</i>, the first string
in the list is always the text up to the first match, and the last
string in the list is always the text after the last match.

<p>
To complete the illustration of the <i>tokenizeOn...:</i> variants, if
<i>tokenizeOnString:</i> is used in place of <i>tokenizeOn:</i> in the previous
example, the following output is generated:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;The quick brown fox jumped over >
&lt;the>
&lt; lazy dog.></pre></b></ul>

and, if <i>... tokenizeOnPattern: "[Tt]he"</i> is used in place of
<i>... tokenizeOnString: "the"</i>, the following result is produced:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;The>
&lt; quick brown fox jumped over >
&lt;the>
&lt; lazy dog.></pre></b></ul>

Before leaving the topic of tokenization, there is another noteworthy example.  <i>ctokenizeOn:</i>, given an empty argument, can be used to quickly
convert a string into a list of its characters.  For example:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>"abc" ctokenizeOn: "".
do: ["&lt;" print; print; ">" printNL];</pre></b></ul>

generates the output:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;>
&lt;a>
&lt;>
&lt;b>
&lt;>
&lt;c>
&lt;></b></pre></b></ul>

This behavior is used to produce the high performance version of the
<i>toList</i> String method, supplied in the FIXcore.6.1.1 script.

<p>
While empty character sets always produce well defined answers when
passed as an argument to <i>breakOn:</i>, <i>tokenizeOn:</i>, <i>cbreakOn:</i> and
<i>ctokenizeOn:</i>, they can cause problems for the string and pattern
matching variants of these primitives.  That is because empty strings
and patterns always match the beginning of any input and never consume
any characters from that input.  The result is a sure-fire recipe for
an infinite loop.  To prevent that, special provision is made in these
primitives to detect empty search strings and patterns.  If an empty
string or pattern is detected, only the first, empty match will be
returned.  Thus, either:

    <ul type=disc><b><pre>"abc" breakOnString: "". do: ["&lt;" print; print; ">" printNL];</pre></b></ul>

or:

    <ul type=disc><b><pre>"abc" breakOnPattern: "()". do: ["&lt;" print; print; ">" printNL];</pre></b></ul>
    
displays:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;>
&lt;abc></pre></b></ul>

while either:

    <ul type=disc><b><pre>"abc" tokenizeOnString: "". do: ["&lt;" print; print; ">" printNL];</pre></b></ul>

or:

    <ul type=disc><b><pre>"abc" tokenizeOnPattern: "()". do: ["&lt;" print; print; ">" printNL];</pre></b></ul>

displays:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;>
&lt;>
&lt;abc></pre></b></ul>

While on the topic of regular expressions and string pattern matching,
there is one final point to be made. The regular expression processing
algorithms used by all string pattern matching primitives in Vision
always match the longest possible substring.  For simple patterns,
this isn't usually an issue, but, for patterns with wildcards, some
care needs to be taken.  For example, in the examples of this section,
if:

    <ul type=disc><b><pre>s tokenizeOnPattern: "[Tt]he". do: ["&lt;" print; print; ">" printNL];</pre></b></ul>

had been written as:

    <ul type=disc><b><pre>s tokenizeOnPattern: "[Tt].*e".do: ["&lt;" print; print; ">" printNL];</pre></b></ul>

the resulting output would have been:

    <ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;>
&lt;The quick brown fox jumped over the>
&lt; lazy dog.></pre></b></ul>

instead of:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>&lt;The>
&lt; quick brown fox jumped over >
&lt;the>
&lt; lazy dog.></pre></b></ul>

<h3 id=stringcaseconversion>String Case Conversion</h3>

Five new unary primitives have been defined in the EXTcore.6.1.1
script to change the case of a string.  Four of these primitives are
direct replacements for non-primitive methods currently in use --
<i>toUpper</i>, <i>toLower</i>, <i>capitalize</i>, and <i>lowercase</i>.  The fifth,
<i>toggleCase</i>, flips the case of all upper and lower case characters
it finds in its input string.  All of these primitives return a
suitably modified copy of their input.  
  

<hr>
<p>
<h3 id=stringclustering>String Clustering</h3>

<p>
Prior to this release, there was no direct mechanism for placing a
string in a specific cluster.  Only the Vision bulk loader (a.k.a.,
the incorporator) had that ability.  The implementation and
performance consequences were significant and often hard to recognize.
Release 6.1.1 introduces a collection of primitives that facilitate
string clustering.

<p>
Beginning with this release, strings can be clustered using a
mechanism known as associative clusters.  Associative clusters apply
only to strings.  Associative string clusters are similar to
dictionaries in that they examine the text of a string and store at
most one copy of a string based on its text.  Additionally, like
dictionaries, the instances in an associative cluster are ordered by
their text.  The script EXTcore.6.1.1 contains the new primitives
defined to support string clustering.  These primitives will not work
with earlier releases.

<p>
Not all string clusters are associative string clusters.  Associative
string clusters are created using the <i>newAssociativeCluster</i>
operation:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>!stringSpace &lt;- String newAssociativeCluster;</pre></b></ul>

The <i>string</i> returned by <i>newAssociativeCluster</i> is the shadow
instance of a new associative cluster containing no instances.
The message <i>isAnAssociativeCluster</i> returns a boolean indicating
whether the recipient String is part of an associative string cluster.

<p>
Strings are added to the associative cluster using the message
<i>insertIntoCluster:</i>:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>!a0 &lt;- "a" insertIntoCluster: stringSpace;</pre></b></ul>

or its converse, <i>clusterInsert:</i>:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>!a1 &lt;- stringSpace clusterInsert: "a";</pre></b></ul>

As noted, only one copy of "a" is inserted into the cluster -- both
<i>a0</i> and <i>a1</i> reference the same copy of the string "a".

<p>
Associative clusters can be queried to determine if they contain a
particular string.  The <i>locateInCluster:</i> message or its converse,
<i>clusterLocate:</i> perform that function.  Both messages return the
instance of the string in the associative cluster if the string is
present and NA if it isn't.  In the context of this example, both:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>"a", "b" do: [
    ^self print: 3;
     ^self locateInCluster: ^my stringSpace. printNL
];</pre></b></ul>

and:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>"a", "b" do: [
    ^self print: 3;
     ^my stringSpace clusterLocate: ^self. printNL
];</pre></b></ul>

display:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>a  a
b        NA </pre></b></ul>

Strings can be deleted from an associative cluster using the
 <i>deleteFromCluster:</i> message or its <i>clusterDelete:</i> converse:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>Input:
"a" deleteFromCluster: stringSpace

Output:
TRUE

Input:
stringSpace instanceList

Output:
List of 0</pre></b></ul>

Both deletion messages return TRUE if the string was found and deleted
and FALSE if the string was not present in the first place.  If the
same string is deleted in the context of a list operation:

    <ul type=disc><b><pre>"a", "a" do: [
    ^self print: 2;
    ^self deleteFromCluster: ^my stringSpace. printNL
];</pre></b></ul>

only one instance of the delete operation returns TRUE:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>a FALSE
a TRUE</pre></b></ul>

As is the case with any deletion, all references to the deleted
string are automatically converted to references to the shadow
instance of the associative cluster.

<p>
Strings stored in associative clusters are protected from deletion
using the standard instance deletion messages -- <i>delete</i> and
<i>rdelete</i>.  If one of these messages is sent to an associative cluster
resident string, the deletion will fail and the message will return
FALSE:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>Input:
!a0 &lt;- "a" insertIntoCluster: stringSpace
Output:
a

Input:
a0 rdelete
Output:
FALSE

Input:
a0
Output:
a</pre></b></ul>

While strings in associative clusters are protected from accidental
deletion, they are not protected from damage by the incorporator.  If
an associative string cluster is used as an incorporator string store,
it will be severely damaged and will need to be re-created.


<hr>
<p>
<h3 id=clusterobjectspace>Cluster Object Space Assignment</h3>

<p>
As of this release, it is possible to explicitly assign newly created
transient clusters to specific persistent object spaces.  Previously,
that assignment was made based on the first persistent reference to
the new cluster encountered during the initial save of the new
cluster.  The script EXTcore.6.1.1 includes new primitives used to
locate new clusters.  These primitives will not work with earlier
releases.  

<p>
Cluster object space assignments are made with the message
 <i>establishResidenceInSpaceOf:</i> :

<ul type=disc><b><pre>Object createSubclass: "MyClass";
MyClass establishResidenceInSpaceOf: AnotherClass</pre></b></ul>

or its converse <i>provideResidenceFor:</i>:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>Object createSubclass: "MyClass";
AnotherClass provideResidenceFor: MyClass</pre></b></ul>

<i>AnotherClass</i> is assumed to have a persistent identity (i.e., it was
saved previously or given a persistent identity using the cluster
object space assignment messages described here).  If <i>AnotherClass</i> has
a valid persistent identity (i.e., an object space), <i>MyClass</i> will be
assigned to the same object space as <i>AnotherClass</i>.

<p>
Both the <i>establishResidenceInSpaceOf:</i> message and its converse
return TRUE if the object space assignment was performed successfully
and FALSE if it failed.  The object space assignment can fail if the
<i>new</i> cluster already has a persistent identity or if the <i>old</i>
reference cluster doesn't.  If the assignment fails, no identity
changes occur.


<hr>
<p>
<h3 id=ieeenan>IEEE NaN->NA Conversion</h3>

<p>
As of this release, the numeric primitives (add, subtract, multiply,
divide, power, subtracted from, divided into, and power of) convert
IEEE NaN (Not a Number) values into Vision NAs.  Previously, only
division by zero generated Vision NAs; other conditions like overflow,
underflow, and loss of precision returned the IEEE NaN generated by
the hardware.  While these NaN values propagated correctly through
subsequent computations, Vision programs could not test for them or
control their display.


<hr>
<p>
<h3 id=typedefragcoal>Type Defragmentation/Coalescing </h3>

<p>
When sending a message to a collection of objects, Vision's virtual
machine partitions that collection by the type of its elements.  For
each type found, the virtual machine locates the implementation of the
message and applies that implementation to the set of elements in the
associated partition.  The objects returned become the recipients of
the next message sent by the expression being evaluated.  In general,
the objects returned can be of different types, and more importantly,
objects of the same type can be returned in several of the partitions.
The effect of this recursive partitioning is fragmentation (in fact,
the structure used to hold these partitioned intermediate results is
called a fragmentation).  Common examples of this occur when a message
returning a boolean is sent to a polymorphic collection of objects or
different execution paths generated by <i>ifTrue:</i> and its variants all
return objects of the same type.

<p>
There is a performance and clustering tradeoff between performing a
computation on a recursively fragmented collection versus coalescing
the fragmentation.  Coalescing similar types can result in larger and
more efficiently organized partitions; however, there is a cost
associated with searching for coalesceable fragments and with
performing the defragmentation.  Historically, Vision deferred
defragmentation because, in the majority of cases, that resulted in
better average performance.  In some cases, particularly those
involving the creation of new persistent objects, this decision had an
adverse affect on clustering, update performance, or both.  A new,
high performance, defragmentation algorithm implemented in this
release changes the tradeoff.  As of this release, Vision's default
behavior is to attempt aggressive defragmentation prior to sending a
message to a fragmented collection.

<p>
Vision's type defragmentation behavior can be controlled by the
 <i>visionAttemptDefragment</i> session attribute (defined in the
accompanying extension scripts) or the <i>VisionAttemptDefragment</i>
environment variable.  Aggressive defragmentation can be disabled by
setting the session attribute to FALSE:

    <ul type=disc><b><pre>Utility SessionAttribute visionAttemptDefragment &lt;- FALSE;</pre></b></ul>

or by setting the environment variable to 0:

       <ul type=disc><b><pre>setenv VisionAttemptDefragment 0    # c-shell syntax</pre></b></ul>

prior to starting a Vision session.

<p>
<h3 id=optimizedgarbagecoll>Optimized Garbage Collection and Session Garbage Collection</h3>

<p>
The internal queuing mechanism used by the network maintenance
garbage collector (<i>Utility collectGarbage</i>) has been reimplemented to
yield a performance improvement of up to an order of magnitude (10x)
in some cases with the effect most noticeable on large databases with
many containers.

<p>
Vision has always utilized a reference counting mechanism to enable
the collection of transient objects that are no longer needed.  This
mechanism works well in most situations, but fails in the case of
circular references.  If a circular reference is introduced, the
reference count of any object in the path of the circular reference
will never drop to zero, nor will that of any objects referenced by
objects in the circular path.  This release includes a mark-and-sweep
garbage collector for transient objects similar to the mark-and-sweep
global garbage collector.  The EXTcore.6.1.1 script includes the new
primitive <i>collectSessionGarbage</i> which can be explicitly invoked to
perform transient garbage collection.  It is automatically invoked
whenever:  
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<ol type=1>
<li>an allocation error is encountered.
<li>when a Vision session has been idle for more than 30 seconds. </ol></ul>

<hr>
<p>
<h3 id=errorhandling>Error handling in batchvision</h3>

<p>
A serious Vision error (reported in the NDF.ERROR file, and in the
session log with the preface <i>>>> Error Trapped by Read-Eval-Print
&lt;&lt;&lt;</i>) traditionally leaves the session active, but unable to commit
changes to the object network. This policy provides an opportunity for
determining the cause of the error by exploring the state of the
session.  This remains Vision's default policy; however, with this
release, there are two other possible responses to a serious error.

<p>
One of the new possibilities is to choose to exit the session. The
second is to restart the session. In both cases, all access to the
environment developed in the session prior to the error is lost. In
the restart case, a batchvision with the same standard input and
output channels replaces the original session.  If both exit and
restart are chosen, exit takes precedence.

<p>
This feature has been provided because, after a serious error, the
batchvision session may be unable to relinquish some system
resources. On some platforms, this inability is more serious than
others, and can result in other batchvision sessions being stalled
until the session with the error exits or restarts.

<p>
There are two ways to enable restart or exit on error.  One is via
environment variables:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>setenv VisionExitOnError 1
setenv VisionRestartOnError 1</pre></b></ul>

The second is via session attributes:

<ul type=disc><b><pre>Utility SessionAttribute visionExitOnError &lt;- 1;
Utility SessionAttribute visionRestartOnError &lt;- 1;</pre></b></ul>


<hr>
<p>
<h3 id=tuneableupdate>Tuneable Update Write Size</h3>

<p>
Some operating and file system configurations do not work correctly
when presented with large disk write requests.  These failures are
caught by Vision's update checksum mechanism; however, they require
that the failed update be re-run.  This release implements a tuning
parameter that controls the maximum amount of data that Vision will
attempt to transfer to disk during a single update write.  Either the
session attribute <i>visionMaxWriteChunk</i> or the environment variable
 <i>VisionMaxWriteChunk</i> can be set to the maximum number of bytes that
Vision will attempt to transfer.  By default, this parameter is set
internally by Vision to not exceed the documented limits of the
operating system on which Vision is running.  You should not change
the value of this parameter unless you are encountering or suspect
that you are encountering a problem caused by an operating system bug.

<h3 id=minorenhancements>Minor Enhancements and Bug Fixes</h3>

<p>
<ol type=1><li>batchvision
  <ol type=a>
	<li>The <i>asObject</i> message when sent to a POP representing a Block
	   now returns a decompiled string. Previously it had returned an
	   NA. This is in support of the new <i>Selector Not Found</i> handling.
	 <li>Fix to OpenVision process streams to prevent generation of
	   Unix "zombies".
	 <li>Lowered Severity of <i>echoToFile:</i> usage errors to a "warning".
	   This means that the error is not written to the NDF.ERRORS
	   log, and that the session will be able to update the
	   network. The usage errors are still reported to the session.
	   In addition, the primitive now catches an integer argument as
	   a usage error.  In the past, an integer argument would specify
	   an undefined file name, or potentially cause a segmentation
	   fault. 
	 <li>Fixed degenerate case in the <i>FilterOutputOf:</i> primitive. When
	   run from a stream open via communication with an OpenVision
	   service channel, the <i>FilterOutputOf:</i> primitive would
	   sometimes not work. The degenerate case would result when the
	   original input and output streams, opened by default when
	   batchvision starts up, were closed.
	 <li>Enable the setting of the following tuning parameters as
	   Session Attributes. Previously, they could only be modified via
	   environment variables (see EXTcore.6.1.1)
	 <li>Enhanced error reporting for segment mismatches. The
	   expected and actual transaction ids and resource ids for
	   the segment are now included in the error message which is
	   recorded in the NDF.ERRORS log.
	 <li>Modified FilterOutput2 (NT implementation of
	   <i>FilterOutputOf:</i> to return 512 if process creation fails.
	 <li>Modified permission constants for Object Space
	   Creation. In prior releases, if a user was in the global
	   update rights list, then space creation was
	   permitted. Starting with this release, VisionAdm privilege
	   must also be set.
	 <li>If Utility collectGarbage is run in a session, User Space
	   updates are no longer permitted.
	 <li>Any Update Annotations which were previously set to be
	   entered into the NDF, are now also written to NDF.JOURNAL (if
	   it exists.)
	 <li>New primitives to access NDF and process information including
           the version number of the database your session has accessed
           and the session's process id (see EXTcore.6.1.1).
	 <li>When run with the -I option, batchvision now checks the checksum 
	   of the external segments it is being asked to commit. This
	   is subject to disabling via the environment variable
	   VisionCheckCheckSM.
	 <li>Transaction IDs generated by the Windows/NT version of
	   batchvision are now based on the volume serial number of
	   the c: drive of the machine running batchvision and have
	   the same structure as transaction ids generated on UNIX
	   systems.  Previously, Windows/NT transaction IDs were
	   generated from an OLE UUID.
  </ol>
<p>
    <li>compustat2
  <ol type=a>
        <li>Adjusted implementation of Floating point conversion so
	   that NA comparisons would work on all platforms (NT in particular)
        <li>Generalized Header/Trailer filtering  by introducing the
	   <i>-N</i> option.  This allows command line specification of a
	   character string which compustat2 will use to identify
	   "Null" records. If the input string matches the beginning
	   of a record, that record is discarded. By default,
	   compustat2 behaves as though it were called in the
	   following way:

		     <ul type=disc><b><pre>compustat2 -N "000000000000"</pre></b></ul>

	   In other words, it will discard all records which begin
	   with 12 zeros.
  </ol>

<p>
    <li>dbconvert
  <ol type=a>
	 <li>When the transfer of a segment between platforms with the
	   same binary data representation (i.e., no data conversion
	   required) is interrupted, a subsequent run of dbconvert
	   would interpret the partial segment as complete. To correct
	   for this, the 6.1.1 version receives segments into
	   temporary files. Only when the transfer has completed does
	   dbconvert move the segment into place. (The temporary file
	   is the segment number with an <i>x</i> character appended.
	 <li>When running in server mode, dbconvert would send
	   unformatted textual error messages to the client which could
	   not interpret them. Version 6.1.1 of the dbconvert server
	   writes those errors instead to a file specified via the
	   <i>-s</i> option. If the <i>-s</i> option is not specified, dbconvert
	   will use /dev/null as the default repository for these messages.
	 <li>Corrected an error message informing users that a container would
	   extend beyond the end of a segment. In earlier versions, it
	   printed an incorrect container size.
	 <li>Added an error message to inform users when dbconvert cannot
	   recognize a message format.
</ol>

<p>
      <li>preproc2
<ol type=a>	 
        <li>When converting a numeric field, preproc2 now checks to
	   ensure that the entire field is legitimately numeric. In
	   earlier versions, preproc2 would convert whatever string
	   was present. If the string was not numeric, the conversion
	   result would be zero. This version converts such strings to
	   NA values.

	   <ul type=disc><b><pre>For Example			New		Old
'         '			NA		0
'    3    '			3		3
'    .   3'			NA		0
'   42Kzcd'			NA		42</pre></b></ul>
</ol>

<p>
      <li>ndftool
<ol type=a>
  <li>removed inaccurate error report induced by a session which
	    performed multiple saves of which one (not the last) was a
	    base version.
</ol>
<p>
    	<li>onprof/onck
<ol type=a>	
  <li>removed inaccurate error report induced by a space which
	    has no root (container at table slot 1)
	  <li>augmented error messages that report mismatched versions to
	    include the expected and actual version numbers.
	  <li>utility is now tolerant of missing spaces in a network.

<b><pre>********************
   EXTcore.6.1.1
********************</pre></b>
<ul type=disc>
This script contains messages that have been added to the core classes as 
part of release 6.1.1.  Note that many of these messages are primitives
which will only run in release 6.1.1 or higher.  The methods used to
install these primitives relies on messages defined in the EXTprimitives.6.0
script from release 6.0.
</ul>

These messages provide control over various session-temporary attributes.
Note that these messages will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     Utility SessionAttribute
Message   enableVerboseSelectorNotFound
          disableVerboseSelectorNotFound</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These messages are used to toggle the amount of information displayed
when a Vision query encounters a <i>selector not found</i>.  By default,
the verbose mode is disabled.

<p>
Note that these messages will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     Utility 
Message   hostname
          hostId
          username
          processId</pre></b><ul type=disc>

The message <i>hostname</i> displays the logical name of the machine on
which your <i>batchvision</i> is running.  The message <i>hostId</i> displays
the vendor-specific integer uniquely identifying this machine.  The
<i>username</i> message is the name of the current effective user code
running the <i>batchvision</i>.  The <i>processId</i> returns the process 
identifier assigned to the <i>batchvision</i> by the operating system.

<p>
Note that these messages will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     Utility 
Message   accessedNetworkVersion</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message displays the version number of the NDF accessed at session
startup.

<p>
Note that this message will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     Utility 
Message   currentNetworkVersion</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message displays the version number of the last commit performed
by this session.  This will be the same as the accessed version when
no commits have been performed.

<p>
Note that this message will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     Utility 
Message   collectSessionGarbage</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message runs the transient garbage collection.

<p>

</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     Utility 
Message   fullCompact
          fullCompactOf:
          fullCompactExcept:</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These methods have been modified to turn off tracing after execution so
that the release 6.1.1 transient garbage collect does not cause sporadic
printing to occur within a session left running after a compaction.
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     String 
Message   breakOnString: string
          breakOnPattern: stringPattern</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These messages expand on the functionality of the <i>breakOn:</i> message.
While the original <i>breakOn:</i> message divides the recipient string into 
one or more substrings based on a set of one or more characters, these
messages are used to divide the recipient string into one or more substrings
based on a string to match exactly or a regular expression.  The messages
<i>stringBreak:</i> and <i>patternBreak:</i> are converse messages that must be
defined in the database but are not generally called directly.

<p>
Note that these messages will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     String 
Message   tokenizeOn: string
          ctokenizeOn: string
          tokenizeOnString: string
          tokenizeOnPattern: stringPattern</pre></b><ul type=disc>

The <i>breakOn:</i> message variations return the text between matches as a 
list of the form "substring-1", "substring-2", ... "substring-n".  The
matched characters, strings, or patterns are not returned as part of 
the list of substrings.  The <i>tokenize</i> versions of these methods
return their results in the form "substring-1", "match-1", "substring-2",
"match-2", ... "match-n-1, "substring-n".  The elements in the returned
list always alternate between the substrings between matches and the
matched text.  If matches occur at adjacent positions in the recipient
string, they are separated by an empty substring in the result. Then
message <i>ctokenizeOn:</i> is similar to <i>tokenizeOn:</i> except a match
occurs for any character in the recipient not included in the parameter.
The messages <i>breakTokenize:</i> and <i>cbreakTokenize:</i>, <i>stringTokenize:</i>,
and <i>patternTokenize:</i>  are converse messages that must be
defined in the database but are not generally called directly.

<p>
Note that these messages will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     String 
Message   toList
          translateString: string to: replacement</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These modified messages used the new <i>ctokenizeOn:</i> and <i>breakOnString:</i>
primitives to produce much faster implementations.

<p>
Note that these modifications will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     String 
Message   translatePattern: pattern to: replacement</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message replaces all occurrences of the supplied <i>pattern</i> with
the <i>replacement</i>.

<p>
Note that this message will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     String 
Message   toUpper
          toLower
          capitalize
          lowercase
          toggleCase</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These messages are used to change the case of the characters in the
recipient string.  The first four of these messages replace non-primitive
methods currently in use.  The <i>toggleCase</i> method flips the case of
all upper and lower case characters it finds in the recipient.   

<p>
Note that these messages will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     String 
Message   newAssociativeCluster</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message creates a new associative string cluster and is normally
sent to ^global String.

<p>
Note that this message will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     String 
Message   isAnAssociativeCluster</pre></b><ul type=disc>

This message returns a boolean value indicating if the recipient is an
associative string cluster.

<p>
Note that this message will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     String 
Message   insertIntoCluster: cluster
          clusterInsert: stringValue</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These messages add the <i>stringValue</i> into an associative cluster if it 
is not already present in it and return the value stored in the cluster.
Because associative clusters maintain only one copy of any string, the
value returned will have the same contents as the one in inserted but
may not be the same string object.

<p>
Note that these messages will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     String 
Message   locateInCluster: cluster
          clusterLocate: stringValue</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These messages return the instance of the string in the associative
cluster if the string is present and NA if it is not.

<p>
Note that these messages will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>
<b><pre>Class     String 
Message   deleteFromCluster: cluster
          clusterDelete: stringValue</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These messages delete a string from an associative cluster.  They return
TRUE if the string was found and deleted and FALSE otherwise.  If the 
same string is deleted more than once in a list operation, only one
instance of the delete operation will return TRUE.

<p>
Note that these messages will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1
</ul><hr>

<b><pre>Class     Object 
Message   establishResidenceInSpaceOf: object
          provideResidenceFor: aCluster</pre></b><ul type=disc>

These messages can be used to explicitly assign newly created
transient clusters to specific persistent object spaces.  Cluster object
space assignments are made with the message <i>establishResidenceInSpaceOf:</i> :
<ul type=disc><b><pre>Object createSubclass: "MyClass";
MyClass establishResidenceInSpaceOf: AnotherClass</pre></b></ul>
or its converse <i>provideResidenceFor:</i>:
<ul type=disc><b><pre>Object createSubclass: "MyClass";
AnotherClass provideResidenceFor: MyClass</pre></b></ul>

<i>AnotherClass</i> is assumed to have a persistent identity (i.e., it was
saved previously or given a persistent identity using the cluster
object space assignment messages described here).  If AnotherClass has
a valid persistent identity (i.e., an object space), <i>MyClass</i> will be
assigned to the same object space as <i>AnotherClass</i>.

<p>
Both the <i>establishResidenceInSpaceOf:</i> message and its converse
return TRUE if the object space assignment was performed successfully
and FALSE if it failed.  The object space assignment can fail if the
 <i>new</i> cluster already has a persistent identity or if the <i>old</i>
reference cluster doesn't.  If the assignment fails, no identity
changes occur.

<p>
Note that these messages will not work with releases prior to 6.1.1

<b><pre>********************
   CHadmin.6.1.1
********************</pre></b>
<ul type=disc>
This script contains modifications and additions related to the AdminTools
ToolKit.  These messages work with pre-6.1.1 versions of the database as
well.  These messages are frequently used by Insyte support personnel to
help analyze object structure complexity.


</ul>
<b><pre>********************
   CHfeeds.6.1.1
********************</pre></b>
<ul type=disc>
This script contains modifications and additions related to the DataFeed
class.  The <i>reconcile</i> method is modified to keep track of the last
timestamp and count each time a feed is run.  This is a transitional
change - more audit information will be recorded in a separate descriptor
class in a future release.
