<h3 id="overview">Currency Overview</h3>
<p>
The <b>Currency</b> class is used to track exchange rate information between
currencies.  Instances of the class currency represent the currencies
in which monetary transactions are performed such as "US Dollars" or
"British Pounds".  

<p>
The Currency class is a direct subclass of Entity:
<font size=+1><pre>
          <a href="clObject.htm">Object</a>
             |
          <a href="clEntity.htm">Entity</a>

             <b>Currency</b>
</pre></font>
<hr>
<p>
<h3 id="access">Basic Access</h3>
<p>
Your Vision system has a number of currencies pre-defined
using the ISO standard identifiers and names.  To display the
code and name for each defined currency use:<pre><tt><b>
     Currency masterList
        sortUp: [ name ] .
     do: [ code print: 15 ; name printNL ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
The time series <i>usExchange</i> tracks daily exchange rates
to convert a specific currency into US Dollars.  Exchange rates
are stored as the number of foreign currency units that are 
equivalent to one US Dollar.  This time series is
usually updated daily as part of the production processing.  
To set the exchange rate for a specific currency as of a date,
just update the time series directly.  For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Currency CAD :usExchange asOf: 9512 put: 1.32 ;
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
Since <i>usExchange</i> is a time series property, you can use any
of the standard <a href="mTS.htm">TimeSeries messages</a> with it.  For
example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Currency CAD :usExchange asOf: 9512 
</b>and<b>
     9512 evaluate: [ Named Currency CAD usExchange ] 
</b></tt></pre>
return the value of the Canadian exchange rate as of December 1995
(i.e., 1.32) and the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Currency CAD :usExchange 
        from: 950101 to: 951231 .
        displayAll 
</b></tt></pre>
displays all the Canadian exchange rate values stored for 1995.
<p>
The message <i>exchangeTo: targetCurr relativeTo: date</i> is used to
access the exchange rate between the recipient and a target
currency as of a specific date.  The result is returned in units of
target currency to source currency so it can be used to multiply
values in the source currency to convert to results in the target
currency.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Currency USD
        exchangeTo: Named Currency CAD relativeTo: 9512 
</b></tt></pre>
returns the exchange rate in units of Canadian dollars to US dollars
(i.e., 1.32).
You can multiply a value expressed in US dollars by this exchange
rate to create an equivalent amount in Canadian dollars.
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Currency CAD
        exchangeTo: Named Currency USD relativeTo: 9512 .
</b></tt></pre>
returns the exchange rate in units of US dollars to Canadian dollars
(i.e., .76).
You can multiply a value expressed in Canadian dollars by this exchange rate
to create an equivalent amount in US dollars.
<p><hr><p>
<h3 id="related">Creating Related Currencies</h3>
<p>
Monetary values are sometimes expressed in a variation of a currency.
For example, you may have some data expressed in pence instead of
pounds, but your exchange rate data is only available in pounds.
You can establish the relationship between pence and pounds as
illustrated below:<pre><tt><b>
     Currency createInstance: "UKPound" ; 

     Currency createInstance: "UKPence" .
       setUnderlyingCurrencyTo: Named Currency UKPound 
                  withExchange: 100 ; 
</b></tt></pre>
These expressions create two new currency instances.  The "true"
currency is the UKPound currency.  You will maintain the
<i>usExchange</i> time series for this currency.
The UKPence currency is converted
to UKPound values by dividing the result by 100.   You do not
maintain the <i>usExchange</i> time series for the UKPence currency.
The <i>exchangeTo:relativeTo:</i> message will automatically perform
the extra conversion when the source or target currency is a "non-true" 
currency such as UKPence.
<p>
The message
<i>isTrueCurrency</i> can be used to find the "true" currency instances.
The properties <i>underlyingCurrency</i> and <i>underlyingExchange</i> are
used to track the related currency and conversion units for
"non-true" currencies.  For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Currency masterList select: [ isTrueCurrency not ] .
     do: [ code print: 10 ;
           underlyingCurrency code print: 10 ; 
           underlyingExchange printNL ;
         ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
displays the underlying currency and exchange rate for all
currencies that are not "real".
<p><hr><p>
<h3 id="dynamic">Dynamic Currency Support</h3>
<p>
The fixed property <i>baseCurrency</i> has been defined at Object and is
used to indicate the actual currency
in which data values for a particular instance are stored and
accessed by default.  Its value should be set to an instance of the
class Currency.  Objects whose values are stated
in a currency can use this property to facilitate
the process of restating values in alternative currencies.  
<p>
To set the value for the <i>baseCurrency</i> property, use the message
<i>setBaseCurrencyTo:</i>.  The parameter to this message can be a currency
instance or a string that refers to a currency instance.  For
example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Company GM setBaseCurrencyTo: Named Currency USD ;
</b>or<b>
     Named Company GM setBaseCurrencyTo: "USD" ;
</b></tt></pre>
Normally, you do not change the base currency of an instance once it
has been defined.
<p>
By default, the base currency of an object is used to display all
monetary values.
Several messages have been defined that allow you
to override this default.  The <i>currency</i> message at Object
is defined to check to see if an override has been set.  If the
override is NA, then the <i>baseCurrency</i> is used; otherwise, the
override is used.  In other words, the message 
<i>baseCurrency</i> will always return
the actual currency of an instance; the message <i>currency</i>
will return the override if it exists, the base currency otherwise.  
<p>
The <i>evaluate:</i> message is defined at the class Currency 
to evaluate all expressions in the supplied block using the recipient
currency.  This message redefines the currency override
for the duration of the block's execution.  Expressions within the
block can redefine the currency again, if desired.  For example,
to display GM's data in Canadian dollars use:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Currency CAD evaluate: [
       Named Security GM
       do: [ price printNL ;
             "Base Currency: " print ; baseCurrency printNL ;
             "Currency Used: " print ; currency printNL ;
           ]
     ] ; 
</b></tt></pre>
Note that the <i>baseCurrency</i> will continue to be US but the
<i>currency</i> will be the Canadian currency inside the block.
To display the price in both currencies, you could use the
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Currency CAD evaluate: [
       Named Security GM
       do: [ price print ; 
             baseCurrency evaluate: [ price print ] ;
             "Base Currency: " print ; baseCurrency printNL ;
             "Currency Used: " print ; currency printNL ;
           ]
     ] ; 
</b></tt></pre>
The first price will be displayed in Canadian dollars; the second
will be displayed in the base currency.
<p>
The message <i>asCurrency</i> can be sent to a string to convert it into
a currency instance.  The previous example could be rewritten as:<pre><tt><b>
     "CAD" asCurrency evaluate: [
       Named Security GM
       do: [ price print ; 
             baseCurrency evaluate: [ price print ] ;
             "Base Currency: " print ; baseCurrency printNL ;
             "Currency Used: " print ; currency printNL ;
           ]
     ] ; 
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
The message: <i>inCurrency:do:</i> 
provides an alternative technique that is sometimes more readable.
The currency parameter can be either a string or an actual
currency.  The previous example could be rewritten as:<pre><tt><b>
      Named Security GM
        inCurrency: "CAD"
       do: [ price print ; 
             baseCurrency evaluate: [ price print ] ;
             "Base Currency: " print ; baseCurrency printNL ;
             "Currency Used: " print ; currency printNL ;
           ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
The message <i>setAsDefault</i> is defined at Currency and 
is used to change the currency override for all
subsequent executions in your session.  The new value is in
effect until changed to a different value or cleared.  You can 
override this default using the <i>Currency evaluate:</i> and
<i>inCurrency:do:</i> messages described above.  For example,
if you execute:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Currency CAD setAsDefault 
</b></tt></pre>
in your session, then the expression:<pre><tt><b>
       Named Security GM
       do: [ price print ; 
             "Base Currency: " print ; baseCurrency printNL ;
             "Currency Used: " print ; currency printNL ;
           ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
will automatically execute using Canadian dollars.  The expression:<pre><tt><b>
      Named Currency USD evaluate: [
       Named Security GM
       do: [ price print ; 
             "Base Currency: " print ; baseCurrency printNL ;
             "Currency Used: " print ; currency printNL ;
           ] ;
     ] ; 
</b></tt></pre>
will execute using US dollars even if the global override has been set.
The message <i>clearDefault</i> is defined at the Currency class and is
used to clear the currency override value.
It is sent to the class itself using:<pre><tt><b>
   Currency clearDefault ;
</b></tt></pre>
If the global override for Currency has been cleared, the
<i>baseCurrency</i> is used by default.  The <i>displayGlobalOverride</i>
message defined for Currency
can be used to display the current override:<pre><tt><b>
     Currency displayGlobalOverride
</b></tt></pre>
<p><hr><p>
<h3 id="methods">Writing Currency-Adjusted Methods</h3>
<p>
By convention, message names that begin with the character '_' 
represent properties containing unadjusted data values in its initial units.
For example,
the property <i>_totalMarketValue</i> defined at Account would return the
total market value of the account in its base currency.  The message
<i>totalMarketValue</i> returns the value in the current currency (i.e.,
the override value if it exists, the base currency otherwise).
<p>
The property and method could be defined as illustrated below:<pre><tt><b>
     #--  Define actual value for time series in base currency
     Account define: '_totalMarketValue' ;

     #--  Define access method in current currency
     Account
     defineMethod:
     [ | totalMarketValue |
       _totalMarketValue *
       ( baseCurrency exchangeTo: currency relativeTo: ^date)
     ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
The method accesses the exchange rate between the base currency
(i.e., the currency in which the value is stored) and the "active"
currency (i.e., the current override value for the currency) as of
the current evaluate date.  Note that the exchange rate will be 1 if no
currency override is in effect.  The unadjusted market value number is
multiplied by this exchange rate to restate it in the current
currency.  
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Account XYZ totalMarketValue
</b></tt></pre>
returns the value in the base currency, and the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     "CAD" asCurrency
         evaluate: [ Named Account XYZ totalMarketValue ]
</b></tt></pre>
accesses the value in the Canadian currency.  
<p>
You can change the
currency and evaluation date using a number of variations including:<pre><tt><b>
     9511 evaluate: 
       [ "CAD" asCurrency 
         evaluate: 
           [ Named Account XYZ totalMarketValue 
           ]
       ]
</b>or<b>
    "CAD" asCurrency evaluate:
       [ 9511 evaluate:
           [ Named Account XYZ totalMarketValue 
           ]
       ] 
</b></tt></pre>
The message <i>currencyFactor</i> has been defined at Object to return
the exchange rate between the base currency for an object and
the override currency as of the current evaluate date.  The
<i>totalMarketValue</i> method could therefore be rewritten as:<pre><tt><b>
     Account
     defineMethod:
     [ | totalMarketValue |
       _totalMarketValue * currencyFactor
     ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
<p>

<h3 id="euroDef">The Euro Currency</h3>
<p>
The <i>euro</i> is simply another instance of <b>Currency.</b>  It will
normally be included as part of your standard currency or exchange
rate processing with the ISO code of <i>EUR</i>.  This instance
is created as part of all Vision installations starting with 
release 6.1.2.
<p>
As of January 1, 1999, daily exchange rates between 
the <i>euro</i> and the <i>US dollar</i> should be supplied as part
of your daily exchange rate feed.  Just like any other currency,
this value will be stored in
the time series <i>usExchange</i> for the <i>EUR</i> currency instance.

<p>
<h3>Historical Analysis</h3>
<p>
Most of the issues involved with using the <i>euro</i> relate to
viewing data that existed prior to its introduction.  Since there will be no
"official" exchange rate history for the <i>euro</i> prior to 1/1/99,
what is the "correct" way to present this information if the user
asks to see the data in currency <i>EUR</i>? Four possibilities exist:
<p>
<ol>
<li>return <i>NA</i> indicating that the data cannot be expressed
in currency <i>EUR</i>
<li>return the data in its reported currency
<li>apply the fixed euro conversion rate for the country
<li>apply a floating synthetic rate
</ol>
<p>
The first two of these cases can be handled by setting the appropriate
initial value in the <i>usExchange</i> time series for currency <i>EUR</i>.
If you want to return the value <i>NA</i> prior to 1/1/99, make sure
you have no value (or the value <i>NA</i>) stored prior to this date.
If you want to return the value in
its reported currency, the value of <i>1.0</i> should be stored
in this time series as of the initial date.  This will result in
the reported value (in its reported currency) being multiplied by
a currency factor of <i>1.0</i>, which is the equivalent of returning
the reported value in its reported currency for dates prior to the
introduction of the <i>euro</i> exchange rate.
<p>
Note: Starting with release 6.1.2, the
initial value is set to <i>NA</i>. However, older Vision installations initialized the time series
to return <i>1.0</i>.
<p>
Alternative 3, applying a fixed
conversion rate for pre-euro data, involves defining
an additional property, <i>fixedRateToEuro</i> at the <b>Currency</b>
class to store the fixed euro conversion rate for each participating
country.  A second property, <i>fixedEuroRateEnabled</i> can be enabled
or disabled to control whether you want this rate applied by default
or on demand.  The fixed euro rate is enabled by default,
beginning with release 6.1.2.
<p>
The final option, using a daily synthetic rate, can be implemented
by creating an additional <b>Currency</b> instance and populating
its <i>usExchange</i> time series with a daily synthetic rate, both
historically and into the future.
<p>
<h3>Using the Legacy Currency</h3>
<p>
Many Vision installations
want to change the default currency for securities and companies
in participating countries to the <i>euro</i> so that data is accessed 
and displayed in euros by default.  This can be accomplished
by setting the <i>baseCurrency</i> property for these entities to
the currency <i>EUR</i>.  By default, data stored in <b>DataRecord</b>
and <b>DataSet</b> instances associated with these entities
will automatically be converted from the reported currency and
displayed in <i>euros</i>.  For example, assume the following:
<p>
<ul><ul>
<li>GermanSec has a price of 100 DEM on 12/31/98
<li>GermanSec's base currency is set to EUR 
<li>The fixed conversion rate from DEM to EUR is 2
</ul></ul>
<p>
The Vision expression:<pre><b>
     981231 evaluate: [ Named Security GermanSec price] </b></pre>
will return the value of 50 <i>euros</i>, since price data is
automatically converted from reported currency to the security's
base currency.  
<p>
Prior to changing the base currency to <i>EUR</i>, you will probably want 
to keep a reference to the legacy currency.  We recommend adding a new
property, <i>_legacyCurrency</i> to store this value for entities
that are being changed to the <i>euro</i>.  The cover method
<i>legacyCurrency</i> returns this currency if set, the base currency
otherwise.  The <i>setBaseCurrencyTo:</i> method at Entity has been
modified in release 6.1.2 to automatically set the <i>_legacyCurrency</i>
when you change the base currency to <i>EUR</i>.
<p>
To display data in the <i>LEGACY</i> currency, use 
the Vision expression:<pre><b>
     Named Currency LEGACY evaluate:
       [ securityList do: [ ] ;
       ] ;
</b></pre>
This usage instructs Vision to display the data for each security
in the list using its legacy currency.  
<p>
<h3>Monetary Data Stored at Entity</h3>
<p>

<b>Note: </b>
This approach assumes that you continue to update the legacy currency
exchange rates after 1/1/99.  These rates will continue to provide
the Legacy to US exchange rate.  If your currency source does not 
provide these values, they can be computed and stored daily using
the calculation:
<ul type=disc><pre><b>legacy fixed rate to EUR * daily EUR to US rate</b></pre></ul>

The <i>ExchangeRateFeed</i> data feed computes these legacy rates automatically.
<p>
Vision Installations that predate release 6.1.2 may wish to review the <a href="euro.htm">Euro</a> document for more information.
