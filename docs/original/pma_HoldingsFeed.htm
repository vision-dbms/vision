<h2>Summary:</h2>
<p>
<ul>
The <i>HoldingsFeed</i> feed is used to create <b>Holding</b>
     instances for one or more <b>Portfolio</b> or <b>IndexAccount</b>
     instances for one or more time periods.  Instances of the
     class <b>Holding</b> are used to represent the amount of a security
     that is held in an account at a specific point in time.
     Each record supplied by this feed is used to create a new <b>Holding</b>
     instance for the referenced account.  
<p>
     The <b>Holding</b> class and its relationship to the <b>Account</b>
     subclasses are described in detail in the
     <a href="clpmaAccount.htm#holdings"><i>Portfolio Management Application
     Classes</i></a> document.  A number of <a href="#related feeds">related feeds</a>
are available
     to create new <b>Portfolio</b>, <b>AggAccount</b>, 
     <b>IndexAccount</b>, and <b>CompositeAccount</b> instances 
     and to update other account-based information.

</ul>

<h2>Special Processing Rules:</h2>
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>The <i>acctId</i>, <i>secId</i>, and <i>date</i> fields must be supplied.
     The <i>acctId</i> must correspond to an existing <b>Portfolio</b> or
     <b>IndexAccount</b> instance.  The <i>secId</i> must correspond to
     an existing <b>Security</b> instance.  The <i>date</i> can be in any
     valid date format such as <i>19971215</i> or <i>12/15/97</i>.
<p>
<li>Holdings created by this feed will replace existing holdings for
     any <i>acctId/date</i> combination included in this feed.  
     You must therefore supply a record for each security held for each <i>acctId/date</i>
     included, even if you are just modifying existing holdings.
<p>
<li>The total market value of the holding is derived using the following 
     rules:
<p>
<dl>
<dt><dd>- If the <i>mval</i> field is supplied, it represents the market value.
<dt><dd>- Otherwise, if the <i>secId</i> is "CashUS", the value of the
       <i>shares</i> field is used, if present.
<dt><dd>- Otherwise, if the referenced account is an <b>IndexAccount</b>
       and no shares are supplied, the security's market capitalization
       as of the supplied date is used.
<dt><dd>- Otherwise, the market value is computed as the supplied <i>shares</i>
       field multiplied by the security's price.  If the <i>price</i>
       field is supplied, this price is used; otherwise, the stored
       price for the security as of the supplied date is used.  This
       computed value is multiplied by the <i>unitCalc</i> of the
       security's type (which is usually 1).
</dl><p>
     This value is used to update the <i>_totalMarketValue</i> property
     of the holding.  The value is assumed to be in the same currency
     as the referenced account.
<p>
<li>If the <i>mval</i> field is not supplied, then the <i>unitCalc</i> field must be used in the <a href="pma_SecurityTypeMaster.htm">SecurityType Master</a>.
<p>
<li>If the <i>shares</i> field is not supplied, it is calculated
     as the computed total market value divided by the supplied price
     if present, the security's price otherwise.
     If the <i>shares</i> field is supplied, it
     should refer to the actual shares held on the supplied date,
     unadjusted for any splits that have occurred since that date.
     This value is used to update the <i>_shares</i> property of the holding.
<p>
<li>If the <i>totalCost</i> field is not supplied, it is computed as the
     product of the <i>shares</i> and <i>unitCost</i> fields if they are
     supplied.  This value updates the <i>_totalCost</i> property of the
     holding.  The value is assumed to be in the same currency as the 
     referenced account.
<p>
<li>If the <i>price</i> is supplied, it will update the
     <i>_accountingPrice</i> property of the holding as well as the <i>_accountingPrice</i> and <i>accountingCurrency</i> properties in the price record. The <i>accountingCurrency</i> is set to the currency of the Portfolio. If the <i>mval</i>
     field is not provided, this price will be used in the calculation
     of total market value if present.  This value is assumed to be
     in the same currency as the referenced account and should represent
     the actual price on the supplied date, unadjusted for any splits that
     have occurred since that date.
<p>
<li>For each <i>acctId/date</i> combination present, the account
     time series properties <i>_totalMarketValue</i>, 
     <i>_totalMarketValueCash</i>, <i>_totalMarketValueEquity</i>, 
     <i>_totalMarketValueFixed</i>, and <i>_totalCost</i>, are
     computed from the holdings created by this feed.  The
     holding properties <i>percentOfPort</i> and <i>percentOfEquity</i>
     are also computed.
<p>
<li>If an <i>adjustDate</i> is supplied, it will update the <i>adjustmentDate</i> property of the holding and split adjustments for the <i>shares</i> property will be computed relative to this date.
<p>
<li>If a <i>currencyId</i> is supplied, the <i>baseCurrency</i> property for the holding will updated and <i>totalMarketValue</i> will be computed using this value. 
<p>
<li>Holdings are recreated for any <b>AggAccount</b> that includes
     one or more <b>Portfolios</b> updated for each date present in the feed.
     If <b>Portfolio</b> instances are included in the feed,
     the holdings cross reference by security is rebuilt for each
     date present.
</ul>
<p>

<h2>Tips:</h2>
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>If the referenced account is an <b>IndexAccount</b>, you can create
     even-dollar holdings by setting the <i>mval</i> field to the same
     value for each record supplied for the <i>acctId/date</i>.
<p>
<li>If the referenced account is an <b>IndexAccount</b>, you can create
     market-cap-weighted holdings by setting the <i>mval</i> field to
     the market capitalization for the security for each record supplied
     for the <i>acctId/date</i>. Alternatively, you can omit
     the <i>shares</i> and the <i>mval</i> fields, and the stored
     market capitalization for the security as of the supplied date
     will be used.
<p>
<li>If the referenced account is an <b>IndexAccount</b> for which only the weight is available, use the HoldingsFeed with the <i>mval</i> field set to the weight.  This has the effect of creating an <b>IndexAccount</b> with total market value of 100 with the individual securities held in proportion to their supplied weight.
