<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>
The <a href="pmaDBA.htm">Vision Administrator Module</a> performs various Database Administration functions
in an interactive Windows environment.  You may find it useful to use scripts to
perform these same functions in a batch environment.  Such sample scripts are
described in this document and can serve as a basis for designing your own.  These
scripts work outside the VAdmin module and allow you to perform multiple functions
and/or load multiple files simultaneously, as well as allow you to keep an 'audit
trail' of your scripting iterations.

<p>The examples as provided assume certain  environment variables have
been set to the standards established in PMA Release 1.7.  If you
are on a prior release, you will need to modify these variables
before running your scripts as described in this document:<p>

On Unix:<p>

Modify the general defaults for Vision Database Administrator processing in <i>/localvision/include/DBAVision.env</i>:
<ul type=disc>        Add <i>setenv VisionAdm 1</i><br>
        Add <i>setenv UserOSI 3</i><br>
        Change the <i>VisionMaxSegSize</i> from <i>50000000</i> to <i>33554432</i></ul>
<p>
On NT:<p>

Modify the System Variables:
<ul type=disc>Add <i>%VisionRoot%bin</i> to the values listed for the Path variable<br>
Add the new variable <i>NDFPathName</i> with a value of <i>%LocalVisionRoot%network\NDF</i></ul>

Modify the User Variables for the Vision Administrator:
<ul type=disc>Add the new variable <i>UserOSI</i> with a value of  <i>3</i><br>
Add the new variable <i>VisionAdm</i> with a value of  <i>1</i><br>
Add the new variable <i>VisionMaxSegSize</i> with a value of <i>33554432</i></ul>
<p>
If you need additional help setting up these variables,  please
contact your Insyte consultant.

<H3><a name="Batch">Creating Batch Scripts</a></h3>
<p>
The server-based software that manages your Vision database
is the component known as <i>batchvision</i>.
When you use VAdmin or one of the Vision editors, you are communicating
with a <i>batchvision</i> process interactively.  The <i>batchvision</i>
program is also used to execute non-interactive programs.
Requests can be submitted to
<i>batchvision</i> via Vision script files.  A Vision script file is
simply a standard text file containing one or more Vision requests.
Any number of requests can be included in a Vision script file.  Each
request is terminated by the <b>?g</b> command which instructs
Vision to begin executing the request.
<p>
For example, assume the message <i>displayWeeklyReports</i> has been
saved in the Vision database and you want to run this program.  You
could create the file <i>testfile</i> which contains the following
lines:
<pre><tt><b>     displayWeeklyReports ;
     ?g</b></tt></pre>
Note that the characters <b>?g</b> must be the only characters on the line
followed by a carriage return.
To execute this Vision script file, it can be used as standard input to the
<i>batchvision</i> program as shown below for both Unix and NT:

<ul><pre><tt><b>batchvision < testfile > testfile.out</b></tt></pre></ul>

The requests in a Vision Script file can access, create, and manipulate
any Vision structures that have been saved in the database or defined
in the script.
<p>
If you want your Vision script to commit any new or changed information
to the database, you need to start <i>batchvision</i> as the Vision Administrator and include an explicit instruction to update the database
in your Vision script.  For example, the following script defines
a new display method for the class Object and saves the method to the
database:

<b><pre>     #---  Vision Script to define and save a new method at Object
     Object defineMethod: [ | display |
        ^self whatAmI print ; ^self creationDate print ;
        ^self code printNL ;
     ] ;
     ?g

     #---  Now save the results - don't forget the ?g on its own line
     Utility updateNetworkWithAnnotation: "define a new display method" ;
     ?g</pre></b>

Assume this script is saved as the file <i>testupdate</i>.  You
can run and save this script on Unix or NT using:

<ul><pre><tt><b>batchvision < testupdate > testupdate.out</b></tt></pre></ul>

Once this script has completed, you will be able to access the new
method any time you connect to the Vision database.
You must be logged in as the Vision Database Administrator
to save the results of this script.
<p>
NOTE: On Unix systems, you need to source the following file before you begin your batch processing:
<ul><pre><b>source /localvision/include/DBAVision.env</b></pre></ul>

<p>

<b>!!!  Warnings !!!</b>
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>When you are testing your Vision scripts you should make sure that
  they do not include the step that updates the database.
<p>
<li>Scripts that contain the ?g characters cannot be loaded via VAdmin.
</ul>
<p>

<h3><a name="Updating">Using BatchScripts to Run DataFeeds</a></h3>
<p>
The VAdmin module limits DataFeed loading to one feed at a time.
Once you have established some basic procedures for loading your
data, you may prefer to create some batch scripts for yourself
that perform the same function for multiple feeds at a time.
<p>
The Vision method for loading a data file via a data feed requires
that you provide the name of the feed, the name of the file, and
an optional <a href="pmaFeeds.htm#config">configuration file name</a>.
  For example, if you want to
load data using the <b>SecurityMaster</b> feed from the file
<i>/localvision/upload/feeds/secmaster.dat</i>, use the expression:

<b><pre>         Interface BatchFeedManager
         upload: "SecurityMaster"
         usingFile: "/localvision/upload/feeds/secmaster.dat"
         withConfig: NA ;</pre></b>

If you have an explicit configuration file to use, replace the
third parameter with the actual file name.
 To update the Security
Master via a batch process, do the following:
<ol type=1>
<li>Create a Vision script that loads and saves the data

<b><pre>         #--  Load the data
         Interface BatchFeedManager
             upload: "SecurityMaster"
             usingFile: "/localvision/upload/feeds/secmaster.dat"
             withConfig: NA ;
         ?g

         #--  and Update the database - don't forget the ?g on its own line
         Utility updateNetworkWithAnnotation: "load single secmaster file" ;
         ?g</pre></b><p>
Note:  On NT systems, if your data files are on a different drive than your script, you need to use the absolute path name.<p>
<li>Save the Vision script as <i>secmaster.vis</i>

<li>Submit this script to <i>batchvision</i> for update. You must be logged in as the Vision Database Administrator to update the database.  For both Unix and NT use:

<ul><b><pre>batchvision < secmaster.vis > secmaster.out</pre></b></ul>

</ol>
Your Vision script can be modified to include multiple updates.
For example, you may want to update a standard set of files each
day in a specific order.  Assume on a daily basis you receive
a security master, company master, portfolio master, prices, and
holdings file.  If you copy these files to a known directory and
name them the same way each day, you can use a single Vision script
to update the set:

<b><pre>         #--  Load the data
         Interface BatchFeedManager
             upload: "CompanyMaster"
             usingFile: "/localvision/upload/feeds/compmaster.dat"
             withConfig: NA ;
         ?g
         Interface BatchFeedManager
             upload: "SecurityMaster"
             usingFile: "/localvision/upload/feeds/secmaster.dat"
             withConfig: NA ;
         ?g
         Interface BatchFeedManager
             upload: "PortfolioMaster"
             usingFile: "/localvision/upload/feeds/portmaster.dat"
             withConfig: NA ;
         ?g
         Interface BatchFeedManager
             upload: "PriceFeed"
             usingFile: "/localvision/upload/feeds/prices.dat"
             withConfig: NA ;
         ?g
         Interface BatchFeedManager
             upload: "HoldingsFeed"
             usingFile: "/localvision/upload/feeds/holdings.dat"
             withConfig: NA ;
         ?g

         #--  and Update the database - don't forget the ?g on its own line
         Utility updateNetworkWithAnnotation: "load daily file" ;
         ?g</pre></b>

<h3><a name="New">Defining New Classes and Properties</a></h3>
<p>
In addition to loading data, the menus in the VAdmin module
provide tools that allow you to define new classes and relationships.
The actual Vision code invoked by VAdmin to perform these functions
is supplied below:

<b><pre>     #--------------------
     #  VAdmin Schema Choice: Create Entity Class
     #      Creates Entity subclass and associated MasterFeed
     #  Inputs -
     #        createEntityClass:      name of subclass to create
     #                     from:      Entity class to subclass
     #--------------------
     Interface BatchFeedManager
        createEntityClass: "SPIndustry" from: "Industry" ;

     #--------------------
     #  VAdmin Schema Choice: Create DataRecord Class
     #      Creates DataRecord subclass and EntityExtenderFeed
     #  Inputs -
     #        createDataRecordClass:     name of subclass to create
     #                         from:     DataRecord class to subclass
     #                     linkedTo:     Entity class to link to
     #                          via:     property to define at linkedTo class
     #                         asTS:     should property be a t/s?
     #--------------------
     Interface BatchFeedManager
       createDataRecordClass: "ModelData" from: "DataRecord"
          linkedTo: "Company" via: "modelData" asTS: "YES" ;

     #------------------------------------------
     #  VAdmin DataFeeds Choice: PropertySetup
     #      Define properties for new DataRecord Class
     #  Inputs -
     #               classId:   name of class/subclass properties are assigned to
     #              property:   name of property
     #                tsflag:   is property a t/s? Y or N
     #              datatype:   class of object returned by this property
     PropertySetup updateFromString:
         #--  these are tab-delimited
         "classId  property  tsflag  datatype
         ModelData	model1	N	Number
         ModelData	model2	N	Number
         ModelData	model3	N	Number
         ";


     #--------------------
     #  VAdmin Schema Choice: Create Relationship
     #      Creates MembershipFeed and property tracking relationship
     #              at the group and member entity classes supplied
     #  Inputs -
     #        createRelationship:     name of MembershipFeed class to create
     #             withGroupType:     Entity class of Groups
     #                       via:     list property defined at group class
     #             andMemberType:     Entity class of Members
     #                       via:     property defined at member class
     #                      asTS:     should properties be t/s?
     #--------------------
     Interface BatchFeedManager
       createRelationship: "CompanyToSPIndustry"
          withGroupType: "SPIndustry" via: "memberList"
          andMemberType: "Company" via: "spIndustry" asTS: "YES" ;</pre></b>


You can include these functions in any batch script you submit for update.
<p><hr><P>

<h3><a name="ModelData">ModelData Sample</a></h3>
<p>
Assume that you want to track several model scores about a company over
time.  You need to:
<ol type=1>
<li>Create the <b>ModelData</b> class as a <b>DataRecord</b>
        linked to <b>Company</b> over time.

<li>Define the model properties for your new class.

<li>Load model data for specific company/date combinations.
</ol> 
The following Vision script can be used to define the new class:

<b><pre>     Interface BatchFeedManager
       createDataRecordClass: "ModelData" from: "DataRecord" 
          linkedTo: "Company" via: "modelData" asTS: "YES" ;
     ?g

     PropertySetup updateFromString:
        "classId     property     tsflag     datatype
         ModelData   model1       N          Number
         ModelData   model2       N          Number
         ModelData   model3       N          Number
        " ;
     ?g

     Utility updateNetworkWithAnnotation: "Define ModelData class" ;
     ?g</pre></b>


This creates the class <b>ModelData</b> and defines three properties.  
Model data for the three model values can be updated using
the <b>ModelDataFeed</b>.  For example, if you create a file
named <i>models.dat</i>, that contains:

<b><pre>     id     date     model1     model2     model3
     ibm    9801     1          2          3
     ibm    9802     2          2          3
     dell   9801     10         12         14</pre></b>

you can update it using:

<b><pre>         Interface BatchFeedManager 
             upload: "ModelDataFeed"
             usingFile: "models.dat
             withConfig: NA ;
         ?g</pre></b>

Access to the data is provided via the Vision expression:

<b><pre>      Named Company IBM modelData
      do: [ date print: 15 ; 
            model1 print ;
            model2 print ;
            model3 printNL ;
          ] ;</pre></b>

<h3><a name="Maintenance">Database Maintenance Functions</a></h3>


A set of database maintenance functions needs to be performed 
periodically to reclaim space and compress structures that
have become sub-optimal as the result of many updates to the
database.  These functions are described in the table below:
<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80% cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2>
<tr><th>DBA Function<th>Description
<tr>
<td><i>Database Cleanups and Garbage Collection</i>
<td>Performs various cleanup activities that are standard for all
installations.
<tr>
<td><i>Compaction</i>
<td>Physically moves unused information out of the database and
temporarily relocates it elsewhere on the disk.
<tr>
<td><i>Delete Segments</i>
<td>Removes the unused information identified by the compaction process.
</table></center>
<p>
In a starter environment, these maintenance activities are invoked
interactively using the VAdmin module as needed.  As you move towards
a production environment, you may prefer to create a batch process that
performs these maintenance tasks.
<p>
The <i>adminScripts</i> directory in the <i>localvision</i> directory
contains batch scripts that perform these functions.  On Unix systems,
this directory is accessed via <i>/localvision/adminScripts</i>.
On NT systems, this directory is located in <i>c:\localvision</i> by 
default, but is usually relocated during the installation process.  
The environment variable <i>LocalVisionRoot</i> 
refers to the location chosen for the <i>localvision</i> directory
on NT.
<p>
The following scripts are included in the <i>adminScripts</i>
directory:
<p>
<center><table border=1 width=80% cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2>
<tr><th colspan=2>Maintenance scripts in <i>/localvision/adminScripts</i>
<tr><th>Script Name <th>DBA Function
<tr>
<td><i>garbageCollect.cmd</i>
<td>Database Cleanups and Garbage Collection
<tr>
<td><i>fullCompact.cmd</i>
<td>Compaction
<tr>
<td><i>deleteCompactSegments.cmd</i>
<td>Delete Segments
<tr><td><i>batchCleanup.cmd</i><td>Includes above 3 functions in one script.
</table></center>
<p>
These scripts can be run directly from the operating system prompt.
You must be logged in as the Vision Administrator.  


<p>
<font size=+1>Running Maintenance Scripts in Unix</font>
<p>
On Unix systems, you need to source the following file before you start your batchvision session:


<ul><pre><b>source /localvision/include/DBAVision.env</b></pre></ul>
<p>
To run a script, type the script name and redirect its output to 
another file.  For example:

<ul><pre><b>/localvision/adminScripts/garbageCollect.cmd > /localvision/logs/gc.yymmdd</b></pre></ul><p>
Note that if you setup an automated procedure to run the maintenance tools
that bypasses the standard login procedure, you should include the
following "source" statement in your procedure:

<ul><pre><b>source /localvision/include/DBAVision.env</b></pre></ul>


<font size=+1>Running Maintenance Scripts on NT</font>
<p>
To run a script, type the script name and redirect its output to 
another file.  For example:

<ul><pre><b>%LocalVisionRoot%adminScripts\garbageCollect.cmd > %LocalVisionRoot%logs\gc.yymmdd</b></pre></ul>
<font size=+1>When to Run the Maintenance Scripts</font>
<p>
Large production environments typically run the maintenance functions
nightly in order to optimize their space utilization.  In this type
of environment we recommend the steps run in the sequence employed
by the <i>batchCleanup.cmd</i> script:
<ul type=disc><b><pre>deleteCompactSegments.cmd
garbageCollect.cmd
fullCompact.cmd</pre></b></ul>
This sequence introduces a one day lag in the removal of segments
flagged for deletion, allowing for deleted segments to be backed up
in case they are needed for recovery activities.
<p>
Your environment may not require the maintenance functions to be run
as frequently.  If you find you only need to run them on a sporadic
basis, you will probably want to run the <i>deleteCompactSegments</i>
(using the batch script or the VAdmin module) after Compaction to
immediately reclaim the space.   The following guidelines can be
used to determine the optimum frequency for running the maintenance
functions:
</pre></b></ul>TBD</pre></b></ul>


<p><hr><P>


<h3><a name="ObjectSpaces">Creating New Object Spaces</a></h3>

<p>
Object spaces are used to organize functional components of the
Vision database.  They correspond to physical directories in the
localvision/network branch of the file system.  By default, classes,
instances, and data will be stored in object space 3.  This is fine
for prototyping and small systems.  If you plan to load a large
amount of historical data from multiple sources and update on a
regular basis, multiple object spaces are normally appropriate.  The
primary reason to do this is that it will allow the compaction
process to operate more efficiently and effectively.  Most users and
applications will not need to know about the object space structure
in order to use the database since messages encapsulate the
navigations for you.  
<p>
We recommend creating a separate object space for each data source
that loads as a unit on a regular basis.  For example, Barra
data should be physically stored in its own object space.  Note that
your initial installation includes object spaces that have been
pre-allocated for pricing and holdings so there is no need to
create separate object spaces for these sources initially.
<p>
The script <i>installSpace.cmd</i> is available in the
<i>/localvision/adminScripts</i> directory and is used to create
new object spaces.  The script requires that you provide a code
that identifies the object space and an option type that indicates
the role of the object space.  The type can be supplied as one of
<i>DB</i>, <i>DBA</i>, or <i>User</i>.  If omitted, the type is
assumed to be <i>DB</i>.  <i>DB</i> object spaces are used 
to store instances and property values for one or more
classes.  <i>DBA</i> object spaces are used to store
tools to manage various aspects of the database.  <i>User</i> object
spaces are used to store private data for a specific user.
<p>
For example, to install a new object space for storing model data,
run the following command:
<ul type=disc>
   On Unix:
<b><pre>       /localvision/adminScripts/installSpace.cmd Models DB</pre></b>

   On NT:
<b><pre>       %LocalVisionRoot%adminScripts\installSpace.cmd Models DB</pre></b></ul>

After this runs, you should see an 'object space created' message as
well as the normal update message.
<p>
Once you have created your new Models object space you can access it
via:
<b><pre>      Environment DB Models</pre></b>

<p>
NOTE: &nbsp;If you rollback through a space installation, you will need to
 manually delete the associated physical sub-directory under
 localvision/network.  If you are unsure of what the number of the object
 space to be deleted is, refer to the NDF.JOURNAL file in the
 localvision/network directory.

<p><hr><P>


<h3><a name="ObjectSpaceAssign">Assigning New Classes to an Object Space</a>
</h3>

<p>

By default, new <b>Entity</b> classes are created in object space 3 and new
<b>DataRecord</b> classes are created in object space 6.  The instances
of a class and the property values associated with each of these instances
are stored in the object space in which the class is originally installed.
<p>
We recommend creating a separate object space for each data source
that loads as a unit on a regular basis.  For example, your Model
data could be physically stored in its own object space.  
You need to specify
the object space location of a new class prior to its creation using the
following expression:
<b><pre>     #---  Set the object space of the next class created to 
     #--     the space define to hold the Models
     Interface BatchFeedManager setObjectSpaceTo: Environment DB Models;

</pre></b>
You can use the object space name or the object space number as the
parameter to <i>setObjectSpaceTo:</i>.
You must precede each <b>Entity</b> and <b>DataRecord</b> subclass 
creation request with the <i>setObjectSpaceTo:</i> expression if you want
the new class set up in a specific object space.  For example:
<b><pre>     Interface BatchFeedManager
        setObjectSpaceTo: Environment DB Models;
     Interface BatchFeedManager 
        createEntityClass: "ModelType" from: "Classification" ;

     Interface BatchFeedManager
        setObjectSpaceTo: Environment DB Models;
     Interface BatchFeedManager
       createDataRecordClass: "ModelData" from: "DataRecord"
          linkedTo: "Company" via: "modelData" asTS: "YES" ;

</pre></b>
This request will create the new entity class <b>ModelType</b> and
the new data record class <b>ModelData</b> in the object space named
<i>Environment DB Models</i> if the classes do not already exist.
Note that this approach will <b>not</b>
recreate the classes if they already exist
and it will not relocate existing classes to the object space 
specified.

<p><hr><P>

<h3><a name="ClassStores">Creating New DataRecord Stores</a></h3>

<p>
By default, the instances of a class and the property values 
associated with these instances are stored in the object space
in which the class was originally installed.  For <b>DataRecord</b>
subclasses that will store a large number of instances over time,
we recommend that data be physically stored in a new storage structure
in its own object space.  
<p>
Once you have created the space, you will
need to define a "new store" for the class you wish to store in
that space.  For example, to create a new store for <b>ModelData</b> 
in the <b>Models</b> object space, create a Vision script that 
contains the following:

<b><pre>       #--  Create a new store for ModelData in Models object space
       ModelData createNewStoreAt: Environment DB Models ;
       ?g</pre></b>

Once you have saved this script, any new instances created via
the <b>ModelDataFeed</b> will be stored in the <b>Models</b> object space.
<p>
Note that instances and data that existed prior to the creation of the
new store will continue to reside in its original location.  Normally,
you would create the new object space and store immediately after
creating the new <b>DataRecord</b> subclass and prior to updating
any actual data.
<p>
If you use a <b>DataFeed</b> to update your data, the information will
automatically get placed in the last "store" created.  If you are
writing your own Vision methods to load data directly, you will need
to modify any code that creates new instances so it is in the form:

<b><pre>     ^global ModelData currentStore createInstance: "xxx" ;</pre></b>


<p><hr><p>
<h3><a name="Bridges">Creating Bridge Classes and Feeds</a></h3>

<p>
The subclasses of the <b>Bridge</b> class are used to manage
the protocol for connecting an entity to one or more <b>DataRecord</b>
instances.  It is useful when there are complex relationships that
need to be managed and you do not want to overburden the entity
class with all the required information.
An instance of a <b>Bridge</b> subclass is normally
referenced via the entity instance with which it is associated.
<p>
To create a subclass of <b>Bridge</b>, you provide the <b>Entity</b>
class with which the new class is associated, the name of the property
that establishes the connection between an instance of entity's class
and an instance of the bridge's class, and an indication whether the
relationship should vary over time.  
For example, you may want
to create a bridge class called <b>FundamentalBridge</b> which
links to separate data record classes that track annual, quarterly,
and monthly fundamental data.  
To create the <b>FundamentalBridge</b> class and associate
it with the <b>Company</b> entity via the fixed property
<i>fundamentalData</i>, do the following:
<b><pre>
     #--------------------
     #  Create Bridge Class
     #      Creates Bridge subclass and establishes relationship
     #          with existing Entity subclass
     #  Inputs -
     #        createBridgeClass:     name of subclass to create
     #                     from:     Bridge class to subclass
     #                 linkedTo:     Entity class to link to
     #                      via:     property to define at linkedTo class
     #                     asTS:     should property be a t/s?
     #--------------------
     Interface BatchFeedManager
       createBridgeClass: "FundamentalBridge" from: "Bridge"
          linkedTo: "Company" via: "fundamentalData" asTS: "NO" ;

</pre></b>
You can create and attach the different data records to this class
using: <b><pre>
     Interface BatchFeedManager
       createDataRecordClass: "AnnualData" from: "DataRecord"
          linkedTo: "FundamentalBridge" via: "annual" asTS: "YES" ;
     Interface BatchFeedManager
       createDataRecordClass: "QuarterlyData" from: "DataRecord"
          linkedTo: "FundamentalBridge" via: "quarterly" asTS: "YES" ;

</pre></b>
The <b>PropertySetup</b> feed can be used to define updateable properties
for the <b>AnnualData</b> and <b>QuarterData</b> classes and the
<b>AnnualDataFeed</b> and <b>QuarterlyDataFeed</b> classes can be used
to update these properties for specific companies on specific dates.
<p>
Once these classes have been established, you can access the specific
fundamental data record using: <b><pre>
     Named Company IBM fundamentalData annual  #insert property name
or
     Named Company IBM fundamentalData quarterly   #insert property name
</pre></b>

<h3><a name="LocalEntity">LocalEntity Bridges and Private Object Spaces</a></h3>

<p>
A <b>LocalEntity</b> is an abstract subclass of <b>Bridge</b> designed
to provide special protocol for a subset of instances of a specific
entity class to enable private saves.  <b>LocalEntity</b> subclasses can be created in a way that allows them to connect with their underlying entity dynamically.
As a result, these bridge classes, and their related data record
classes can be stored in a way that allows them to be updated privately.
<p>
For example, suppose the Equity Research group wants to update information
about a subset of companies without requiring the intervention of the
global database administrator.  A separate object space can be created
for this group.  The <b>ERCompany</b> bridge class and one or more 
data record classes can be created in this space.  Data associated with
this bridge class can then be updated privately.
<p>
Here are the steps involved with setting up a private space that
can be updated using data feeds:
<p><ol>
<li>Use the <a href="#ObjectSpaces"><i>installSpace.cmd</i></a> script
to create a new object space:<b><pre>
       /localvision/adminScripts/installSpace.cmd MySpace
</pre></b>
<p><li>Set the permissions on this space so that the private user and
the Vision Administrator can update it.
<p><li>As the Vision Administrator, define and save a <b>LocalEntity</b> bridge
in this space for any entity class you wish to extend with private
data:<b><pre>
       Interface BatchFeedManager 
          setObjectSpaceTo: Environment DB MySpace ;
       Interface BatchFeedManager
            createBridgeClass: "MyCompany" from: "LocalEntity" 
            linkedTo: "Company" via: "myCompany" asTS: "Method" ;
</pre></b>
<p><li>As the Vision Administrator, define and save one or more
<b>DataRecord</b> classes attached to this bridge in this space:<b><pre>
       Interface BatchFeedManager
           setObjectSpaceTo: Environment DB MySpace ;
       Interface BatchFeedManager
            createDataRecordClass: "AnalystRating" from: "DataRecord"
            linkedTo: "MyCompany" via: "rating" asTS: "Y" ;

       Interface BatchFeedManager
           setObjectSpaceTo: Environment DB MySpace ;
       Interface BatchFeedManager
            createDataRecordClass: "CompanyAnnualOverride" from: "DataRecord"
            linkedTo: "MyCompany" via: "companyAnnualOverride" asTS: "Y" ;
</pre></b>
<p><li>If you want to create private <b>Entity</b> classes in your
private space, you must save the following Vision code in the private
space: <pre><b>
     Environment DB MySpace 
          define: 'Entity' toBe: CoreWorkspace Entity newPrototype ;
     Environment DB MySpace 
          define: 'Named' toBe: CoreWorkspace Named newPrototype ;

</b></pre>
This code must be saved by the Vision Administrator.
<p><li>As the Vision Administrator, define and save one or more
<b>Entity</b> classes.  Note that you must start your <i>batchvision</i>
with the -U# option, where # indicates the private object space 
number:<pre><b>
       Interface BatchFeedManager
           setObjectSpaceTo: Environment DB MySpace ;
       Interface BatchFeedManager 
          createEntityClass: "MyIndustry" from: "Entity" ;

</pre></b>
</ol>
Once the Vision Administrator has saved the appropriate classes,
the private user can use the feeds to update the database using the
<i>upload:usingFile:withConfig:</i> message.  The private user must
follow these steps:
<ul>
<p><li>Log in as the private user
<p><li>Start batchvision with the -U## option (or set the <i>UserOSI</i>
environment variable) where ## is the private object space number 
<p><li>When the <i>Utility updateNetworkWithAnnotation:</i> runs, the message
<i>User Space Updated</i> should display instead of <i>Object Network
Updated</i>.
</ul>
<p>
Note that private updates should not run when general vision 
database maintenance is in progress.  This includes garbage collection
and compaction.

<h3><a name="EstimateBridge">Creating Estimate Bridges and Feeds</a></h3>
<p>
<p>
The subclasses of the <b>EstimateBridge</b> class are used to manage
the relationship between an entity or bridge and 
data that can be estimated for multiple time periods. 
To create a subclass of <b>Bridge</b>, you provide the <b>Entity</b>
or <b>Bridge</b>
class with which the new class is associated, the name of the property
that establishes the connection between an instance of this class
and an instance of the estimate bridge's class, the type of 
estimate record, and the periodicity of the estimate.
For example, you may want to create an estimate bridge for
tracking  annual company eps estimates made by an analyst as well
as consensus estimate provided by a source such as I/B/E/S:
<b><pre>
     #--------------------
     #  Create EstimateBridge Class
     #  Inputs -
     #    createEstimateBridgeClass: name of subclass to create
     #                         from: EstimateBridge class to subclass
     #                     linkedTo: Entity or Bridge class to link to
     #                          via: t/s property to define at linkedTo class
     #      withEstimateRecordClass: subclass of EstimateRecord
     #                      andFreq: periodicity of estimates
     #--------------------

     Interface BatchFeedManager
         createEstimateBridgeClass: "EpsABridge" from: "EstimateBridge" 
         linkedTo: "Company" via: "analystEpsEst" 
         withEstimateRecordClass: "AnalystEstimateRecord" 
         andFreq: 12 monthEnds ;

     Interface BatchFeedManager
         createEstimateBridgeClass: "IbesEpsABridge" from: "EstimateBridge" 
         linkedTo: "Company" via: "ibesEpsEst" 
         withEstimateRecordClass: "ConsensusEstimateRecord" 
         andFreq: 12 monthEnds ;

</pre></b>
<p>
Once the estimate bridges have been created you can use the appropriate feed to update the database using the <i> upload:usingFile:withConfig:</i>  message.
