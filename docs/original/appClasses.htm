<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
A number of <b>Abstract Classes</b> have been defined to organize different
components of your Vision class hierarchy.  Abstract classes are not
normally instantiated directly; instead they serve to organize a set
of subclasses that share some basic behavior.  Built-in abstract
classes include <b>Collection</b> which is the superclass of
<b>List</b> and <b>TimeSeries</b> and <b>Ordinal</b> which is the
superclass of <b>Number</b>, <b>Date</b>, and <b>String</b>.
<p>
It is useful to have a basic hierarchy for your application classes
as well.  Several abstract classes have been defined to help organize 
application classes: 
<p>
<ul type="disc">
<li>Entity
<li>DataRecord
<li>LinkRecord
<li>Bridge
<li>DataFeed
<li>DBEntity
</ul>
<p>
Most applications will interact with the database via <b>Entity</b>
instances.  The other classes are used to store data or manage navigations
from an entity to other parts of the database.
<p>
The organization provided by these classes is intended to serve 
as a guideline that can be applied as appropriate.
These classes are all defined in Vision and can 
therefore be modified and expanded as needed by the database
designer. 
<p>
<blockquote><hr><center id="missingDefs"> <b>Note:</b></center>
Some of the classes referenced in this document were added to the Vision
bootstrap database as part of release 5.9.4.  If your installation
was bootstrapped prior to this, you may need to define the
following:<pre><tt><b>
     Entity createSubclass: "Support" ;
     Entity createSubclass: "Table" ;
     Object createSubclass: "Bridge" ;
     IncorporatorPrototype createSubclass: "DataFeed" ;
</b></tt></pre>

<h2><a href="clEntity.htm" name="entity">Entity Classes</a></h2>
<p>
The <b>Entity</b> class is a superclass of the
classes whose instances represent
real-world entities such as companies, products, and industries.  Instances
of the entity subclasses are named, often with several different aliases.
Instances of the entity subclasses normally have one or more descriptive
names in addition to a unique identifier.
Instances of the entity subclasses are often referenced individually
by name or as the value of a property of another entity instance.  
Almost all applications are designed to start with a specific entity
or a set of entities.
<p>
Core entities in your application domain are normally defined as direct
subclasses of <b>Entity</b>.  In an investment management application, these
entities could include: 
<i>Company</i>, <i>Security</i>, <i>Account</i>, and <i>Broker</i>.
In a pharmaceutical application, these entities could include: <i>Drug</i>,
<i>Pharmacy</i>, <i>HealthPlan</i>, and <i>Doctor</i>.  
<p>
Entity classes represent objects that are named.  Every entity subclass
has a corresponding <a href="clEntity.htm#access">naming dictionary</a>
that allows you to reference specific instances by one or more
identifiers.  The properties <i>name</i>, <i>shortName</i>,
<i>sortCode</i>, and <i>numericCode</i> are defined for the class.
Initially these properties are all set to the value of <i>code</i>;
you can modify any or all of these values as needed.
<p>
<h4 id="classify" href="clClassify.htm">The Classification Class</h4>
<p>
The class <b>Classification</b>
has been defined as an abstract subclass of <b>Entity</b> to
organize subclasses which are used for grouping and summarization
purposes.  This class is included with all Vision installations.
Instances of <b>Classification</b> subclasses are normally referenced
by other Entity instances.  For example, the property <i>region</i>
could be define for the class <b>Company</b> to return
an instance of the <b>Region</b> class representing the region
in which the company is based and the
property <i>industry</i> could be defined to return an instance of the
class <b>Industry</b> representing the company's major industry.
<p>
Instances of many classification subclasses are often managed as a
hierarchy.  For example, <i>Industry 123</i> may refer to "Book
Publishing", <i>Industry 120</i> may refer to "General Publishing", 
and <i>Industry 100</i> may refer to "General Media".  
The <b>Classification</b>
class provides protocol to link these instances into a hierarchical
structure.

<p>
<h4 id="miscEntity">Support and Table Classes</h4>
<p>
Two additional abstract subclasses, <b>Support</b> and
<b>Table</b> are recommended for organizing classes that require
objects that are individually named that are not really core
entities in the application.  Note that these classes may need to
be <a href="#missingDefs">added to your database</a> if you want
to use them.  There is no special protocol that needs to be defined
for these classes.  They simply provide a way of organizing the
entity subclasses so that the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Entity showInheritance
</b></tt></pre>
neatly separates the core entity classes from miscellaneous support
classes.  For example, you could create a subclass of <b>Table</b>
when you need a place to store descriptions for coded information.

<p>
<h4 id="currency" href="clCurrency.htm">The Currency Class</h4>
<p>
The class <b>Currency</b>
is a subclass of <b>Entity</b> that is included as part of all Vision
installations.  This 
class is used to track exchange rate information between
currencies.  Instances of the class currency represent the currencies
in which monetary transactions are performed such as "US Dollars" or
"British Pounds".  

<p>
<h4 id="universe" href="clUniverse.htm">The Universe Class</h4>
<p>
The class <b>Universe</b>
is a subclass of <b>Entity</b> that is included as part of all
installations.  Instances of this class are used to name and
track lists of related
entities over time.  For example, a <b>Universe</b> instance named
<i>SP500</i> could be defined to track the list of <b>Security</b>
instances comprising the <i>Standard & Poors 500</i> each month.

<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="data">Data Records</h2>
<p>
The subclasses of <b>DataRecord</b> are used to
manage sets of related information about a specific entity.
These classes provide a way to organize data about an 
entity into manageable substructures.  
<p>
For example, in an investment
management application you need to track various pieces of
pricing information for a security
such as high, low, and closing price.  You could define this
protocol directly at the Security class including properties to
hold the data values and methods for manipulating the values.
Alternatively, you could define a subclass of <b>DataRecord</b>
to manage this information and create a single property that
can link a security instance to its pricing instances over time.
<p>
<b>DataRecord</b> instances are not usually accessed directly.
An instance of a <b>DataRecord</b> subclass is normally accessed via
a property defined at the entity instance with which it is associated.
The <i>createInstance:</i> message for this class assumes you are supplying
four values: the entity, a date, a value, and a base currency if applicable.
<p>
For example:<pre><tt><b>
     #-- Create price time series for Security class
     Entity createSubclass: "Security"
     Security define: 'price' ;

     #-- Create PriceRecord which tracks high, low, and close for a security
     DataRecord createSubclass: "PriceRecord" ;
     PriceRecord defineFixedProperty: 'high' ;
     PriceRecord defineFixedProperty: 'low' ;
     PriceRecord defineFixedProperty: 'close' ;

     #--  Update IBM's prices for several dates
     Security createInstance: "IBM" ;
     Named Security IBM 
     do: [ !newPrice <- ^global PriceRecord createInstance: ^self, 9601 .
               do: [ :high <- 101.25 ; :low <- 100.75 ; :close <- 101.00 ] ;
           :prices asOf: 9601 put: newPrice;
           !newPrice <- ^global PriceRecord createInstance: ^self, 9602 .
               do: [ :high <- 102.25 ; :low <- 100.75 ; :close <- 101.75 ] ;
           :prices asOf: 9602 put: newPrice;
         ] ;

    #-- Display the data
    Named Security IBM :prices
       do: [ ^date print: 15 ; high print ; close print ; low printNL ] ;
</b></tt></pre>

<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="link">Link Records</h2>
<p>
The subclasses of <b>LinkRecord</b> are used to manage
information that symmetrically relates two or more entities.  
For example, in an investment application a holding describes
a relationship between a specific security and account on a specific
date.  Properties of the class <i>Holding</i> could 
therefore include <i>account</i>, <i>security</i>, <i>date</i>, 
<i>sharesOwned</i>, and <i>cost</i>.
A consumer products application could define a subclass of
<b>LinkRecord</b> to manage sales transactions.  Properties of
the class <i>SalesTransaction</i> could include 
<i>product</i>, <i>customer</i>, and <i>store</i>
as well as <i>unitsSold</i> and <i>dollarValue</i>.  The values
of the first three of these properties could be instances of the <i>Entity</i>
subclasses <i>Product</i>, <i>Customer</i> and <i>Store</i>.
<p>
Instances of <b>LinkRecord</b> subclasses are not normally
referenced directly.
Subsets of <b>LinkRecord</b> instances are often cross-referenced
at the entity classes with which they are associated.  For example,
the time series property <i>holdings</i> could
be defined at the <b>Entity</b> subclass <i>Account</i> could 
to return the list of <i>Holding</i> instances associated 
with the specific account instance over time.
The property <i>salesTransactions</i> at the <b>Entity</b> subclass
<i>Customer</i> could be defined to return a list of the
<i>SalesTransaction</i> instances associated with the specific
customer instance.  

<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="bridge">Bridge Classes</h2>
<p>
The subclasses of the <b>Bridge</b> class are used to manage
the protocol for connecting an entity to one more <b>DataRecord</b>
instances.  It is useful when there are complex relationships that
need to be managed and you do not want to overburden the entity
class with all the required information.
<p>
An instance of a <b>Bridge</b> subclass is normally
referenced via the entity instance with which it is associated.

<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="feeds">External Data Sets</h2>
<p>
The classes <b>Data Feed</b> and <b>DataSet</b> are subclasses of
the abstract class <b>IncorporatorPrototype</b> with subclasses that
represent data that is supplied via an external file or transfer.  Each
external feed maps to a specific subclass of <b>DataFeed</b> or <b>DataSet</b>.
The instances of these subclasses correspond to the 
records or rows in the external feed.  The properties of these
subclasses correspond to the fields or columns in the
external feed.  
<p>
Instances of the <a href="clDataFeed.htm"><b>DataFeed</b> subclasses</a>
are normally used to create and update instances of 
<b>Entity</b> and <b>DataRecord</b> subclasses and are not 
normally accessed directly by applications once the data has been
processed.
<p>
Unlike <b>DataFeed</b> classes which are not normally referenced even 
indirectly by other objects, subclasses of <b>DataSet</b> are used to
store information which are an active part of the database.
<b>DataSet</b> instances are normally access via an instance of
the <b>DBEntity</b> subclass, <a href="#dbentity">described below</a>.
Once the data from an external feed has been
incorporated into a <b>DataSet's</b> instances, there is no
logical difference between a <b>DataSet</b> and a <b>DataRecord</b>.

<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="dbentity">DBEntity Classes</h2>
<p>
Data from multiple sources is often managed within a single Vision
database.  This data is normally associated with instances of
one or more entity subclasses.  A specific source may not supply
information for every instance in the related entity class.  The
source may also provide data for entities that do not have a
corresponding entity instance.  In this case, you may not want to
lose the data; however, you do not necessarily want to manufacture new
entity instances to house it.
<p>
The abstract class <b>DBEntity</b> has been defined to provide
protocol for defining pseudo-entities that correspond to the
set of instances tracked by a specific data source.
Subclasses of this
class are normally used to manage the links between core
<b>Entity</b> instances and the actual data supplied by the data
source.  These subclasses are normally named <b>LocalEntity</b>
and are defined in the object space associated with a particular
data source.  In the current Vision database bootstrap, this
class is a direct subclass of <b>Object</b>.  Based on its role,
it should probably be viewed as a subclass of the <b>Bridge</b>
class since it links a single <b>Entity</b> to one or more
<b>DataSet</b> instances.
<p>
More information about the <b>DBEntity</b> model 
<a href="clDBEntity.htm">is available</a>.
