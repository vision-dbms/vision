<a name="List Creation and Basic Access"><b><h3>List Creation and Basic Access</h3></b></a>

<p>Vision allows you to store one or more objects in a list. To create
a list, just separate the objects you wish to include in the list with
commas. For example, assume you wish to create a list containing the companies
GM, IBM, and Exxon and name this list <i>testList</i>. Type and execute
the following:

<ul>
<pre><b>!testList <- Named Company GM, Named Company IBM, Named Company XON </b></pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre><b>List of 3</b></pre>
</ul>

Vision has executed your request and created a variable called <i>testList</i>.
The output <i>aList</i> informs you that you have created a list of elements.
If you wish to suppress the printing of <i>aList</i>, simply type <i>;</i> at
the end of the previous expression. Notice that the expression <i>Named
Company</i> is repeated for each element in the list. The <i><a href="mList.htm#send:">send:</a></i>
message can be used to streamline this operation. Type the following: </p>

<ul>
<pre><b>!testList <- Named Company send: [ GM, IBM, XON ] </b></pre>
</ul>

The two previous examples produce identical results. 

<p>The count message can be sent to a list of elements to return the number
of elements in the list. For example, the expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>testList count</b></pre>
</ul>

returns the number <i>3</i>, the total number of companies in <i>testList</i>.


<p>To access the list of all instances in the class Company, execute the
expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>!fullList <- Company masterList ;</b></pre>
</ul>

Vision has executed your request and created a variable called <i>fullList</i>.
The expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList count</b></pre>
</ul>

returns the number <i>38</i>, the total number of companies in fullList. 

<p>The <i>asList</i> message can be used to produce a 1 element list from
a single object. For example: 

<ul>
<pre><b>!gmAsList <- Named Company GM asList ;</b></pre>
</ul>

produces a list object that contains 1 object, the company GM. You can
append additional objects to <i>gmAsList</i> and use all the other List
messages with this list. 

<p>Individual objects in a List can be accessed directly using the <a href="mList.htm#at:"><i>at</i>:</a>
message. For example, the expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>testList at: 2</b></pre>
</ul>

returns the second element of this list. In this case, the Company object
IBM is returned. The expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>(testList at: 2) = Named Company IBM</b></pre>
</ul>

returns the value <i>TRUE</i>. 

<hr width="100%" ></p>

<a name="The do: Message"><h3><b>The "<a href="clCollect.htm#do">do:</a>" Message</b></h3></a>

<p>Now that you know how many companies are in <i>testList</i>, you may
wish to analyze and display information for each company in the list. The
<i>do:</i> message is used for this purpose. You used this message in a 
previous section to display multiple pieces of information for a single
company. 

<p>The syntax for the <i>do:</i> message is: 

<ul>
<pre><b>list do: [ 
          operation 1 ; 
          operation 2 ; 
          operation 3 ; 
          . . . 
          operation n ; 
         ] ; 
</b></pre>
</ul>

where list is a list of elements (e.g., <i>testList</i>) and each operation
represents an action you want executed for each element in the list. As
usual, each separate operation is followed by the ; character. 

<p>The expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>testList do: [ ticker print; ] ;</b></pre>
</ul>

produces the output:

<ul>
<pre><b>GMIBMXON</b></pre>
</ul>

This program prints the ticker for each company in <i>testList</i>.
However, the output in this example is almost unreadable. That is because
you did not tell Vision to perform a carriage return after printing each
ticker. Instead of using the <i><a href="mList.htm#print">print</a></i>
message, use <i>printNL</i> as shown below: 

<ul>
<pre><b>testList do: [ ticker printNL; ] ;</b></pre>
</ul>

The Output Window should display: 

<ul>
<pre><b>GM 
IBM 
XON</b></pre>
</ul>

This program prints a ticker for each company in <i>testList</i>, followed
by a carriage return. 

<p>The message <i>do:</i> operates like a loop that says print the ticker
for company 1 in <i>testList</i> followed by a carriage return, print the
ticker for company 2 in <i>testList</i> followed by a carriage return,
and so on. If you wished to perform this same operation for a list containing
10,000 companies, only the list name would need to be changed. For example,
you could use <i>fullList</i> to display the ticker for each company instance:


<ul>
<pre><b>fullList do: [ ticker printNL; ] ;</b></pre>
</ul>

Suppose you wish to print the names of the companies in <i>testList</i>.
The expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>testList do: [ name printNL ] ;</b></pre>
</ul>

produces: 

<ul>
<pre><b>General Motors Corp
IBM Corp 
Exxon Corp </b></pre>
</ul>

In addition to name, print the sales for each company in <i>testList</i>.
The expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>testList do: [ name print; sales printNL; ] ;</b></pre>
</ul>

produces:

<ul>
<pre><b>General Motors Corp  101781.00 
IBM Corp 54217.02 
Exxon Corp 76416.00 </b></pre>
</ul>

To get the sales column to line up neatly, specify a column width for
the name using the <i>print:</i> message as shown below: 

<ul>
<pre><b>testList do: [name print: 35; sales printNL; ] ;</b> </pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre><b>General Motors Corp             101781.00
IBM Corp                         54217.02
Exxon Corp                       76416.00</b></pre>
</ul>

The message <i>print: 35</i> reserves 35 spaces for each company's name
and inserts spaces for names that have fewer characters. 

<p>The <i>do:</i> message can be used with calculations as well. Suppose
you wish to calculate the price-earnings ratio for each company in <i>testList</i>.
The expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>testList 
do:[ 
    name print: 35; 
    sales print: 10 ; 
    price / earningsPerShare printNL: 8 ; 
   ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

produces the results: 

<ul>
<pre><b>General Motors Corp    101781.00     6.39
IBM Corp                54217.02     9.26 
Exxon Corp              76416.00     8.62
</b></pre>
</ul>

In this case, the <i>do:</i> message executes three operations for each
element in the list, printing the name, the sales value, and the price-earnings
ratio followed by a carriage return. The sales values is printed in 10
character positions and the price-earnings ratio is printed in 8 positions.
Change <i>testList</i> to <i>fullList</i> to execute this report for all
the companies. 

<hr>

<a name="The select: Message"><b><h3>The "<a href="clCollect.htm#select">select:</a>" Message</h3></b></a>

<p>It is often useful to restrict a list to objects that meet certain criteria.
For example, you may wish to find the companies in <i>fullList</i> whose
sales were greater than 15,000 and produce the previous report for these
companies only. The expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList select: [ sales > 15000 ] . 
do: [ 
     name print: 35 ; 
     sales print: 10 ; 
     price / earningsPerShare printNL: 8 ; 
    ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

produces: 

<ul>
<pre><b>Aetna Life & Cas       22114.11       5.46
American Tel & Tel     51209.02      23.20 
Amoco Corp             20174.00      19.91 
Atlantic Richfield     16282.00      18.15 
Boeing Co              15355.00      26.63 
...</b></pre>
</ul>

This expression selects companies in <i>fullList</i> whose sales were
greater than 15,000 and displays each company's name, sales, and price-earnings
ratio for the companies that passed the criteria.

<p>The <i>select:</i> message returns a list of those elements in the original
list that meet the criteria specified. Pictorially the select: message
works as follows: 

<ul>
<p><img src="list1.gif" lowsrc="list1.gif" alt="select: message structure" border=0 ></p>
</ul>

<p>The resultant list is a new list object that contains a subset of the
objects in the original list. The resultant list can be empty (i.e., contain
no objects) but will never have more elements than the original list. When
you send the <i>do:</i> message to the resultant list, the report is only
produced for those companies in this list. This same task could have been
accomplished by creating a new variable that represents the result of screening
for the specified criteria and then producing the report for this list
as shown below: 

<ul>
<pre><b>!selectList <- fullList select: [ sales > 15000 ] ; 
selectList 
  do: [ 
       name print: 35 ; 
       sales print: 10 ; 
       price/earningsPerShare printNL: 8 ; 
      ]; </b></pre>
</ul>

This program produces results that are identical to the previous example.


<p>If you wish to find the companies that had sales greater than 15,000
and a price-earnings ratio of less than 10, type the expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
 select: [ sales > 15000 && (price / earningsPerShare) < 10 ] . 
 do: [ 
      name print:35; 
      sales print: 10 ; 
      price / earningsPerShare printNL: 8 ;
     ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

You should see

<ul>
<pre><b>Aetna Life & Cas         22114.11      5.46
CIGNA Corp               16909.30      6.90
Chrysler Corp            26276.51      3.92

Travelers Corp           17459.10      5.49 </b></pre>
</ul>

The message <i>&&</i> is the relational operator for <i>and</i>.
It is used to create selection criteria where several criteria must all
be TRUE. The message <i>| |</i> is the relational operator for <i>or</i>
and is used to specify criteria where either or both criteria are TRUE.
For example, if you wish to find the companies whose sales are greater
than 15,000 or that have a price-earnings ratio of less than 15, execute:

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList
    select: [ sales > 15000 || (price / earningsPerShare) < 10 ] . 
     do: [ 
          name print: 35 ; 
          sales print: 10 ; 
          price/ earningsPerShare printNL: 8 ; 
         ]; </b></pre>
</ul>

You should see:

<ul>
<pre><b>Aetna Life & Cas           22114.11        5.46 
American Tel & Tel         51209.02       23.20
Amoco Corp                 20174.00       19.91 
Atlantic Richfield         16282.00       18.15 
Boeing Co                  15355.00       26.63 
...</b></pre>
</ul>

Notice that calculations (e.g., <i>price / earningsPerShare</i>) can
be performed within selection brackets. The selection criteria is really
just a Vision program. Within the square brackets, you can define temporary
variables, perform conditional tests, and do complex calculations to specify
your criteria. 

<hr></p>

<a name="Sort Messages"><b><h3>
<a href="clCollect.htm#sorts">Sort</a> Messages</h3></b></a>

<p>It is often useful to display your information in sorted order. The
<i><a href="mList.htm#sortDown:">sortDown:</a></i> and <i><a href="mList.htm#sortUp:">sortUp:</a>
</i>messages enable you to do this. For example, after you performed your
screen on <i>fullList</i>, you may wish to display the results from highest
to lowest sales. For example, the expression: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
    select: [ sales > 15000 && (price / earningsPerShare) < 10 ] . 
    sortDown: [ sales ] . 
do: [ 
     name print: 35 ; 
     sales print: 10 ; 
     price / earningsPerShare printNL: 8 ;
    ] ;</b></pre>
</ul>

produces the output: 

<ul>
<pre><b>General Motors Corp     101781.00    6.39 
Ford Motor Company       71643.38    4.36 
IBM Corp                 54217.02    9.26 
Citicorp                 27988.01    3.67 
...</b></pre>
</ul>

As with other list messages, you are not limited in the complexity of
the calculation to be sorted on. For example you may sort on the price-earnings
ratio by executing the following: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
    select: [ sales > 15000 && (price / earningsPerShare) < 10 ] . 
    sortUp: [ price / earningsPerShare ] . 
do: [ 
     name print: 35 ; 
     sales print: 10 ; 
     price / earningsPerShare printNL: 8 ;
    ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

producing the results: 

<ul>
<pre><b>Citicorp                 27988.01     3.67
Chrysler Corp            26276.51     3.92 
Ford Motor Company       71643.38     4.36 
Aetna Life & Cas         22114.11     5.46 
...</b></pre>
</ul>

In this case, the <i>sortUp:</i> message was used to sort the values
from lowest to highest price-earnings ratio. You can perform multiple sorts
using the <i><a href="mList.htm#sortUpBy:then:">sortUpBy: then:</a></i>
message and supplying two criteria. For example, to sort by the integer
portion of the price-earnings ratio then by name, use: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
  select: [ sales > 15000 && (price / earningsPerShare) < 10 ] . 
  sortUpBy: [ (price / earningsPerShare) asInteger ] then: [ name ] .
do: [ name print: 35 ; 
      sales print: 10 ;
      price / earningsPerShare printNL:8 ;
    ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

<p>You should see: </p>

<ul>
<pre><b>Chrysler Corp          26276.51     3.92 
Citicorp               27988.01     3.67 
Ford Motor Company     71643.38     4.36 
Aetna Life & Cas       22114.11     5.46 
...</b></pre>
</ul>

Notice that Chrysler now appears before Citicorp. Since the integer
value of the ratio is 3 in both cases, the name sort is used as a secondary
sort. 

<p>Additional variations of the <a href="clCollect.htm#sorts"><i>Sort:messsages</i></a>
are available.
<hr>

<a name="The extendBy: Message"><h3>The <a href="clCollect.htm#extend">"extendBy:"</a>Message</h3></a>

<p>The last example used the calculation price / earningsPerShare three
times (selecting, sorting, and doing) thus creating two inefficiencies.
First, it is tedious to type in the same calculation three times, particularly
when calculations use many variables. In addition, by writing the calculation
three times, you are asking Vision to retrieve the same information for
the same companies three times. As usual, Vision provides a more efficient
way to accomplish this. 

<p>The message <i><a href="mList.htm#extendBy:">extendBy:</a></i> lets
you calculate variables once for each element in the list and then lets
you reuse this information. For example, the previous example can be more
effectively written as follows: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
extendBy: [ !pe <- price / earningsPerShare; 
          ] . 
select: [ sales > 15000 && pe < 10 ] . 
   sortUpBy: [ pe ] then: [ name ] . 
do: [ 
     name print: 35 ; 
     sales print: 10 ; 
     pe printNL: 8 ;
    ] ;</b></pre>
</ul>

This program produces the same output as the prior example. Instead
of calculating <i>price / earningsPerShare</i> three times, the <i>extendBy:</i>
message allows you to create a variable that stores the result of this
calculation once. 

<p>All objects in the list respond to the <i>pe </i>message just like any
other message. All objects in the list continue to respond to the messages
already defined. 

<p>Pictorially the extendBy: message works as follows: </p>

<ul>
<p><img src="list2.gif" lowsrc="list2.gif" alt="extendBy: message structure" border=0 ></p>
</ul>

<p>Within the square brackets, you can define as many variables as you
would like. Each variable should be introduced with the symbol <b>!</b>
followed by a variable name. Each variable that you define can be thought
of as a new column for the list. For example: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
extendBy: [ !pe <- price / earningsPerShare; 
            !margin <- netIncome / sales;
          ] .
select: [ sales > 15000 && pe < 10 ] . 
  sortUp: [ pe ] .
do:[ 
    name print: 35 ;
    margin print ;
    sales print: 10 ;
    pe printNL: 8 ;
   ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

produces: 

<ul>
<pre><b>Citicorp             0.04    27988.01      3.67
Chrysler Corp        0.05    26276.51      3.92

IBM Corp             0.10    54217.02      9.26 </b></pre>
</ul>

The new variable definitions can be as simple or complex as needed.
For example, you could create an additional variable that contains an *
if margin is more than .9 or sales is less than 20,000 using: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
extendBy: [ !pe <- price / earningsPerShare; 
            !margin <- netIncome / sales;
            !flag <- " " ; 
            margin > .9 || sales < 20000
             ifTrue:[ :flag <- "*"; ] ; 
          ] .
select: [ sales > 15000 && pe < 10 ] .
  sortUp: [ pe ] .
do: [ 
     flag print: 2 ;
     name print: 35 ;
     margin print ; 
     sales print: 10 ; 
     pe printNL: 8 ; 
    ] ;</b></pre>
</ul>

<a name="List Rank, Decile, and Quintile Messages">
<h3>List <a href="clCollect.htm#ranks">Rank</a>, 
<a href="clCollect.htm#tiles">Decile</a>, and 
<a href="clCollect.htm#tiles">Quintile</a> Messages</h3></a>

<p>You may wish to determine the rank of each company in a list based on
one of its data values. In <i>fullList</i>, for example, the company with
the highest sales would receive a rank of 1 and the one with the lowest
sales would receive a rank of 38. Vision provides two messages, <i><a href="mList.htm#rankUp:">rankUp:</a></i>
and <i><a href="mList.htm#rankDown:">rankDown:</a></i> for this purpose.
The rankUp:message assigns the value 1 to the list element with the lowest
value for the supplied criteria. The rankDown: message assigns the value
1 to the list element with the highest value for the supplied criteria.</p>

<p>When you send one of these messages to a list, Vision returns an extended
variable for the list named <i>rank</i>. For example, if you wished to
rank the companies selected in the previous examples from highest to lowest
<i>sales</i> and sort the companies by <i>pe</i>, you could execute: </p>

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
extendBy: [ !pe <- price / earningsPerShare;
            !margin <- netIncome / sales;
          ] .
  select: [ sales > 15000 && pe < 10 ] .
  rankDown: [ sales ] . 
  sortUp: [ pe ] . 
do: [ 
     name print: 30 ; 
     margin print ;

The displayed rank indicates the company's position in the list by sales.
Citicorp, with a sales rank of 4, is displayed first because the report
is sorted by <i>pe</i> and Citicorp has the lowest <i>pe</i> value. If
you were to rank and sort the list by the same value, the companies will
display in rank order. For example, to rank and sort the list by <i>pe</i>,
type the following: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
extendBy: [ !pe <- price / earningsPerShare ; 
            !margin <- netIncome / sales ; 
          ] . 
  select: [ sales > 15000 && pe < 10 ] . 
  rankUp: [ pe ] . 
  sortUp: [ pe ] . 
do: [ 
     name print: 30 ; 
     margin print ; 
     sales print: 10 ; 
     rank print ; 
     pe printNL: 8 ; 
    ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

producing the output: 

<ul>

</ul>

Notice that the ranks are in ascending order in this case. 

<p>In the last few examples, you have performed the same <i><a href="mList.htm#extendBy:">extendBy:</a></i>
and <a href="mList.htm#select:"><i>select:</i> </a>operations repeatedly.
You may wish to create a new list that represents the original list containing
only those companies meeting your criteria and providing the two pre-calculations.
To do this, type: 

<ul>
<pre><b>!subset <-
   fullList 
   extendBy: [ !pe <- price / earningsPerShare; 
               !margin <- netIncome / sales; 
             ]. 
select: [ sales > 15000 && pe < 10] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

The variable <i>subset</i> can now be used directly. For example, to
generate the last report using this list type: 

<ul>
<pre><b>subset 
    rankUp: [ pe ] . 
    sortUp: [ pe ] . 
do: [ 
     name print: 30 ; 
     margin print; 
     sales print: 10 ; 
     rank print; 
     pe printNL: 8 ; 
    ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

The output should be identical to the previous report. Notice that there
was no need to do the <i>extend:</i> or <i>select: </i>operations this
time. 

<p>The <i><a href="mList.htm#decileUp:">decileUp:</a></i> and <i><a href="mList.htm#decileDown:">decileDown:</a></i>
messages have been implemented to assign a value from 1 to 10 to each element
in the list based on the criteria supplied. The <i>decileUp:</i> message
assigns the value 1 to the first 10% of the list elements with the lowest
values, the value 2 to the next 10%, and so on with the value 10 assigned
to the list elements in the top 10%. The <i>decileDown:</i> message assigns
the value 1 to the first 10% of the list elements with the highest values
and the value 10 to the list elements in the bottom 10%. When you send
one of these messages to a list, Vision returns an extended variable for
the list named <i>decile</i>. For example: </p>

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
decileDown: [ sales ] . 
do: [ name print: 30 ; 
      sales print: 10 ; 
      decile printNL ; 
    ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

produces the output: 

<ul>

Atlantic Richfield      16282.00    6 
...</b></pre>
</ul>

Each company is assigned a decile value from 1 to 10 based on where
its sales value falls compared to the other companies in the list. The
companies with the largest sales all have the decile value 1. The companies
with the smallest sales all have the decile value 10. Sorting the list
by <i>sales</i> may make this clearer: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList 
decileDown: [ sales ] . 
sortDown: [ sales ] . 
do: [ name print: 30 ; 
      sales print: 10 ; 
      decile printNL ; 
    ] ; </b></pre>

The <i><a href="mList.htm#quintileUp:">quintileUp:</a></i> and <i><a href="mList.htm#quintileDown:">quintileDown:</a></i>
messages are identical to the decile messages except they assign a value
from 1 to 5, returned in a variable named <i>quintile</i>. For example,
you could assign a <i>sales</i> quintile and an <i>earningsPerShare</i>
decile value using the following: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList

<a name="The groupedBy: Message"><h3>The <a href="clCollect.htm#groups">"groupedBy:"</a> Message</a>
</h3>

<p>The <i>groupedBy:</i> message provides you with a powerful tool for
aggregation, enabling you to simultaneously analyze information at a detailed
and aggregate level. The <i>groupedBy:</i> message is used to organize
your original list into a list of sublists or groups based on criteria
that you specify. You can then perform summary analysis on each group as
well as analyze the individual elements in each group. 

<p>The <i>groupedBy:</i> message is often used to group information by industry,
analyst, rating, or any other criteria that allows you to classify similar
information. 

<p>To group the list <i>subset</i> by sector, and display each sector's
name, type the following expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre><b>subset groupedBy: [ industry sector ] . 
do: [ 
     name printNL; 
    ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre><b>Durables 
Finance 
Technology</b></pre>
</ul>

By asking Vision to group subset by sector, Vision returns a list of
the sectors that exist in <i>subset</i>. When you send the <i>do:</i> message
to this list and ask for the name of each element to be printed, the sector
names are displayed. 

<p>Your original list of companies is not lost. Each element in the list
formed by the <i>groupedBy:</i> message responds to the message <i>groupList</i>.
This message returns the list of companies from the original list that
are associated with the specific group. To determine the number of companies
in each sector, type the following: 

<ul>
<pre><b>subset groupedBy: [ industry sector ] . 
do: [ 
     name print: 35 ; 
     groupList count printNL; 
    ] ;</b></pre>
</ul>

producing the output: 

<ul>
<pre><b>Durables           3
Finance            4
Technology         1</b></pre>
</ul>

To display the companies in each sector, and the <i>sales</i>, <i>pe</i>
and <i>margin</i> for each company, type the following: 

<ul>
<pre><b>subset groupedBy: [ industry sector ] . 
do: [ 
     name printNL;                # print sector name

Pictorially the groupedBy: message works as follows: 

<ul>
<p><img src="list3.gif" lowsrc="list3.gif" alt="groupedBy: message structure" border=0 ></p>
</ul>

<p>Grouping introduces a concept known as <b>nested</b> lists. The outer
list represents a list of sectors. Each element in this outer list in turn
responds to the message <i>groupList</i> which returns the set of elements
from the original list that are in the current group. Since this subset
is itself a list, you can perform any list operations on it, including
<i>count</i>, <i>do:</i>, and <i>select:</i>. For example, to sort the
companies in each group by sales, use the following: 

<ul>
<pre><b>subset groupedBy: [ industry sector ] . 
do: [ name printNL ;                           # print sector name

This report organizes the list <i>subset</i> into sectors. Within each
sector the industries are separated, and then the companies are listed
under their corresponding industry. This example uses the <i>groupedBy:</i>
message twice; once to group the original list into sectors; the second
time to group the companies in a given sector into industries. You can
change the initial list from <i>subset</i> to <i>fullList</i>, to display
this report for all companies.

<a name="Statistical Messages" href="clCollect.htm#compute">
<h3>Statistical Messages</h3></a>

<p>Vision offers various messages for calculating summary statistics about
a list. For example, if you wish to calculate the average sales for the
companies in <i>fullList</i> execute: </p>

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList average: [ sales ]</b></pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre><b>25701.95</b></pre>
</ul>

To determine the total sales in <i>fullList</i> execute: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullList total: [ sales ]</b></pre>
</ul>

producing the output: 

<ul>
<pre><b>976674.02</b></pre>
</ul>

Other statistical messages include: 

<a href="mList.htm#average:"><i>average:</i></a>, 
<a href="mList.htm#max:"><i>max:</i></a>,  
<a href="mList.htm#median:"><i>median:</i></a>,

<p>

Many of these messages, such as <i><a href="mList.htm#median:">median:</a></i>
were written in Vision and can be modified or expanded as needed. The brackets
can contain a simple message, a calculation, or a complex program. 

<p>To save the total, average, minimum and maximum sales for the companies
in <i>fullList </i>in the variables fullTot, fullAvg, fullMin, and fullMax
respectively, execute:

<ul>
<pre><b>!tot <- fullList total: [ sales ]; 
!avg <- fullList average: [ sales ]; 
!min <- fullList min: [ sales ]; 
!max <- fullList max: [ sales ]; </b></pre>

To print the results for each variable with a description execute: 

<ul>
<pre><b>"TOTAL SALES" print: 35 ; tot printNL ; 
"AVERAGE SALES" print: 35 ; avg printNL ; 
"MIN SALES" print: 35 ; min printNL ;

<a name="Other List Messages"><h3><b>Other List Messages</b></h3></a>

<p>Many applications require merging several lists together. Vision offers
several messages to support these operations. Start by creating two lists:
<i>techList</i> which contains the companies IBM, DEC, and HWP and <i>highSalesList</i>
which includes companies with sales over 15,000. 

<ul>
<pre><b>!techList <- Named Company send: [ IBM, DEC, HWP ] ; 
!highSalesList <- fullList select: [ sales > 15000 ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

First, determine the number of companies in each list: 

<ul>
<pre><b>techList count</b></pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre><b>3</b></pre>
</ul>

Now type: 

<ul>
<pre><b>highSalesList count</b></pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre><b>22</b></pre>
</ul>

Suppose you wish to create a new list which includes all of the companies
in highSalesList and techList. The <a href="mList.htm#append:">append:</a>
message can be used for this purpose. To define a new list called <i>combinedList</i>
with all of the companies in both lists execute the following: 

<ul>
<pre><b>!combinedList <- highSalesList append: techList;</b></pre>
</ul>

Now count the number of companies in <i>combinedList</i> using: 

<ul>
<pre><b>combinedList count</b></pre>
</ul>

producing the output: 

<ul>
<pre><b>25</b></pre>
</ul>

To print the names of the companies in <i>combinedList</i> type the
following: 

<ul>
<pre><b>combinedList do: [ name printNL ] ;</b></pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre><b>Aetna Life & Cas 
American Tel & Tel 
Amoco Corp 
Atlantic Richfield 
Boeing Co 
CIGNA Corp 
Chevron Corp 
Chrysler Corp 
Citicorp 
DuPont EI de Nemours 
Exxon Corp 
Ford Motor Company 
GTE Corp 
General Electric Co 
General Motors Corp 
IBM Corp 
K Mart Corp 
Mobil Corporation 
Philip Morris Cos 
Procter &amp; Gamble Co 
Sears Roebuck &amp; Co 
Travelers Corp 
IBM Corp
Digital Equipment Corp 
Hewlett-Packard Co 
</b></pre>
</ul>

Notice that IBM appears twice. The <i>append:</i> message does not remove
duplicate companies. To eliminate the duplication, use the <i><a href="mList.htm#union:">union:</a></i>
message. Union finds elements that are in either or both lists specified.
Change the previous example to use <i>union:</i> instead of <i>append:</i> :

<ul>
<pre><b>!combinedList <- highSalesList union: techList; 
combinedList do: [ name printNL; ]; </b></pre>
</ul>

You should see the following:

<ul>
<pre><b>Aetna Life & Cas 
American Tel & Tel 
Amoco Corp 
Atlantic Richfield 
Boeing Co 
CIGNA Corp 
Chevron Corp 
Chrysler Corp 
Citicorp 
Digital Equipment Corp 
DuPont EI de Nemours 
Exxon Corp 
Ford Motor Company 
GTE Corp 
General Electric Co 
General Motors Corp 
Hewlett-Packard Co 
IBM Corp 
K Mart Corp 
Mobil Corporation 
Philip Morris Cos 
Procter & Gamble Co 
Sears Roebuck & Co 
Travelers Corp </b></pre>
</ul>

Notice that this time, IBM appears only once. 

<p>Suppose you wish to create a list of all companies excluding the companies
in <i>techList</i>. Use the <i><a href="mList.htm#exclude:">exclude:</a></i>
message as shown below: 

<ul>
<pre><b>!fullNoTechList <- fullList exclude: techList; 
fullNoTechList count </b></pre>
</ul>

producing the output: 

<ul>
<pre><b>35</b></pre>
</ul>

Notice that now there are only 35 companies. If you wish to know which
ones, you can execute the following: 

<ul>
<pre><b>fullNoTechList do: [ name printNL; ];</b></pre>
</ul>

producing the output: 

<ul>
<pre><b>Aetna Life & Cas 
American Tel & Tel 
Amoco Corp 
Atlantic Richfield 
BellSouth Corp 
...</b></pre>
</ul>

To determine which companies are in both <i>techList</i> and <i>highSalesList</i>,
execute the following:

<ul>
<pre><b>techList intersect: highSalesList . 
do: [ name printNL ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre><b>IBM Corp</b></pre>
</ul>

The <i>numberElements</i> message is used to extend the list by the
variable position which represents the element's position in the list.
For example: 

<ul>
<pre><b>subset numberElements 
do: [ name print: 35 ; 
      position printNL ; 
    ] ; </b></pre>
</ul>

produces the output: 

<ul>
<pre><b>Aetna Life & Cas        1
CIGNA Corp              2
Chrysler Corp           3
Citicorp                4
Ford Motor Company      5 
General Motors Corp     6 
IBM Corp                7
Travelers Corp          8</b></pre>
</ul>
