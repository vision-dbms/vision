<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
The Vision <b>Portfolio Management Application Layer</b> provides
an initial set of application and data feed templates that support
the needs of the portfolio management function.  These templates provide
a good starting point for all installations.  Because of varying 
application, data, and support requirements, the basic product is
normally tailored to meet the specific needs of your organization.
Insyte works with you to implement these customizations and to
develop an on-going production process that suits your environment.
<p>
A successful implementation requires several key ingredients:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>small initial group of end users who are eager for information and want
a role in tailoring the initial applications
<li>strong individual to liaison between users and IT
<li>IT support
</ul>
<p>
Once the software has been installed,
Insyte recommends a three month phased implementation process to
tailor the product to reflect the specific requirements of your organization.  
In addition to introducing end-users
to the capabilities, a key objective during this period is to get
the internal group supporting the product acclimated with the software,  
data integration, and maintenance issues.  Because this installation methodology
involves end users, IT, and support personnel, it encourages
basic knowledge transfer as part of the implementation, which
plays a big role in creating a successful environment.

<h2 id="runtime">The Vision Run-Time Environment</h2>
<p>
The <i>Vision Run-Time Environment</i> provides the tools needed to
build and maintain a Vision database designed to 
deliver Web-based applications to users via an internal intranet.
Basic capabilities provided in this environment include:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Starter Suite of Web-based Applications
<li>Initial Data Feed Templates
<li>Analyst tools for making temporary modifications to the database
<li>Administrator tools for committing permanent changes to the database
</ul>
<p>
This environment addresses the needs of many organizations.
Additional capabilities are provided via the <i>Vision Development
Environment</i>, which offers language access, production scheduling
and other facilities that are useful as your Vision usage expands.  
<p>
The <i>Vision Run-Time Environment</i>
is designed to support three classes of user:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Browser
<li>Analyst
<li>Administrator
</ul>
<p>
A <i>Browser</i> uses a web browser to run applications
via an organization's intranet.  In addition to the
browsing capabilities, an <i>Analyst</i> can
generate temporary modifications to the database.  These modifications
will be reflected in the analyst's private versions of browser reports,
although they will not be saved permanently.  An <i>Administrator</i>
has the ability to commit permanent changes to the database including
data modifications and database extensions that are seen by all users.

<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="software">Software Components</h2>
<p>
The <i>Vision Run-Time Environment</i> includes the Vision Application
Server, one or more Vision Application Clients, and a Vision Administrator
Client.  Since applications are delivered via a user's web browser,
components need to be installed on your internal Web Server as well.
Your Vision Server can be installed on a 
Unix or NT platform.  Your Vision Clients can be installed on an
NT or Windows platform.  A single user environment can be created
using NT as the server and the client.
<p>
The Vision software is available for a number of different 
client/server configurations.  The minimal requirements for each 
configuration are outlined below:
<p>
<b>Server Configuration Requirements</b>
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li><i>Hardware/Operating System:</i>
<ul>
<li>HP/PA-RISC --- HP-UX 10.x
<li>Sun/Sparc --- Solaris 5.5.1
<li>IBM/RS-6000 --- AIX 4.2
<li>Intel Pentium or Pentium/Pro --- 
Windows/NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (Workstation or Server)
</ul>

<li><i>Minimum Main Memory (RAM):</i>
64MB Minimum / 128MB Recommended, more may be required based on user or
application load

<li><i>Minimum Disk Space (exclusive of swap space):</i>
2.5 times average data base size (NTFS formatted disks recommended for
Windows/NT installations); Recommend starting with 1 GB

<li><i>Minimum Swap Space:</i>
2-3 times the installed main memory, more may be required based on user
or application load

<li><i>Other Requirements:</i>
<p>
The following components should be operational prior to installation of
your Vision system:
<ul>
<li><a href="#tcpip">TCP/IP</a>
must be installed and operational in environments where its use
is optional (Windows/NT).
<li><a href="#web">Web server</a>
supporting the Common Gateway Interface (CGI) protocol standard.
</ul>
</ul>


<p>
<b>Client Configuration Requirements</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Web Browser (with Java support for graphics) 
<li>Microsoft Excel 95 or 97
</ul

<p>
<b id="tcpip">Remote Execution Service on Windows NT</b>
<p>
TCP/IP must be installed and operational.  In Unix environments,
this service is standard.  You may need to install remote execution
service software if you are using an NT server.
<p>
The only remote execution service software for NT that we have found and
tested at this time is Ataman Software's ATRLS. 
They can be reached at http://www.ataman.com.
Version 2.4 of Ataman's ATRLS will need the switch set that tells the
rexecd service to leave child processes running after the parent
process logs out. This feature can be found in section 9.3.4 of the
<i>userman.doc</i> file they provide.
Version 1.5 (which is no longer supported by Ataman) works as is with no
additional settings required.

<p>
<b id="web">Web Server Information</b>
<p><table width=90%><tr><td><ul type=disc><li>Web documents provided in the installation are HTML <i>version 3.2 compliant</i>.  Components utilized include <i>HTML Forms</i>,
<i>HTML Tables</i>, and <i>Java Applets</i>.

</table></ul>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="install">Software Installation</h2>
<p>
The Vision software installation is fairly straightforward.  Prior to
sending you a release, you will be contacted by an Insyte technical
consultant who will review your hardware configuration and answer
any specific installation questions you may have.  You will then
receive a release on the medium you requested including basic installation
notes.  Your technical consultant will be available to assist you
over the phone as you install the software and will help you to confirm
that the various components are operating as expected.
Applications are delivered to users via an internal intranet.  If
you do not currently have an intranet running, Insyte can assist
you in installing this software as well.  
<p>
Wherever possible, the installation process has been automated.
A <i>ReadMe</i> file is included at the root level of your distribution
providing instructions for installing the components on different
hardware configurations.  You will need to install:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>The <a href="#serverInstall">Vision Application Server</a>
<li>One or more <a href="#clientInstall">Vision Application Clients</a>
<li>One <a href="#admClientInstall">Vision Administrator Client</a>
<li><a href="#webInstall">Miscellaneous Web Server Components</a>
</ul>
<p>
All users must have user codes defined on the Vision Server machine.
One user should be designated as the <i>Vision Administrator</i>.
You will need to know this user code to install the 
<a href="#serverInstall">Vision Server</a> and the
<a href="#admClientInstall">Vision Administrator Client</a>.
<p>
A number of <a href="pmaInstallTests.htm">installation tests</a>
have been designed to help you confirm that all the pieces are
working and integrated correctly.
<p>
<h4 id="serverInstall">Vision Server Installation</h4>
<p>

Your Vision Server can be installed on Unix or NT
hardware.  The installation instructions differ based on the target hardware.
If possible, you should install the Vision Server while logged in as the
Vision Administrator User.  In this way, the file ownership
and permissions will be established correctly.
<p>
When you have completed the Vision Server installation, you will have
two new directories on your server machine:  <i>vision/</i> and
<i>localvision/</i>.  The <i>vision/</i> directory requires less than
10MB of space and should not grow much larger over time.  The
<i>localvision/</i> directory includes the database itself and should
be located on a disk with sufficient space for growth over time.  
<p>
You will need to contact Insyte to get a valid license file entry
for your server in order to commit updates to the database.
You will need to provide the IP address or host ID for each
server being licensed.  
<p>
Please refer to the document
<a href="admInstUServer.htm"><i>Vision Installation: Unix Server</i></a>
for Unix server installation instructions.
Please refer to the document
<a href="admInstNServer.htm"><i>Vision Installation: NT Server</i></a>
for NT server installation instructions.

<p>
<h4 id="clientInstall">Vision Application Clients</h4>
<p>

Vision Clients can be installed on NT or Windows platforms.  
A single user environment can be created using NT as the server and the client.
Users who access Vision entirely via the web-based applications do
not need the Client software installed on their machine.  However, analysts
that want to extract and/or temporarily modify Vision data from Excel 
must have the Vision Application Client software installed on their machines. Please refer to the document <a href="admInstClient.htm"><i>Vision Installation: Client</i></a>
for Vision client installation instructions.

<p>
<h4 id="admClientInstall">Vision Administrator Client</h4>
<p>

One client should be designated as the Vision Administrator.
The Vision Administrator can be installed on an NT or Windows machine
and connects to the administrator's user code on the Vision Server
machine.  Please refer to the document
<a href="admInstAdmClient.htm"><i>Vision Installation: Administrator 
Client</i></a>
for Vision administrator installation instructions.
<p>
After a client installation is complete, you will want to install the MS Excel
Add-ins for clients that wish to access the Vision Application Server 
via Excel.  Please refer to the document
<a href="admInstExcel.htm"><i>Vision Installation: Excel Add-Ins</i></a>
for installation instructions.
<p>
You may optionally want to install the Windows-based Vision editor for
Vision developers.  A separate setup program is included in the directory
<i>{fill in the blank}/Session</i>.
<p>
<h4 id="webInstall">Web Browser Interface Setup</h4>
<p>

Vision Applications can be delivered to users via a Web-based browser
running on an internal intranet.  
Please refer to the document
<a href="admInstWebConfig.htm"><i>Vision Installation: Web Configuration</i></a>
for instructions.
<p>
To use Vision's web-based applications, there needs to be at least
one running Vision session waiting for browser requests.  These Vision
sessions are known as <i>listeners</i>.  Two types of listener can
be started.  The Vision Administrator can start one or more master
listeners which are available for all browser users.  Master listeners
are started using the <a href="pmaDBA.htm#web">Vision Administrator</a>
module.  Analysts using the Excel add-ins automatically start a
private listener.  When a private listener is running, that user's
browser requests communication with that private session and reflect
any temporary modifications made.  More information
about private listeners <a href="pmaAnalyst.htm#browser">is available</a>.
<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="methodology">Tailoring the Product</h2>
<p>
Once your software has been installed, you are ready to start
loading your portfolio data and viewing reports via
your intranet browser.  Placing the proper emphasis on end user involvement,
data feed design, and on-going 
data management issues during the implementation process
helps to ensure a successful rollout.
<p>
We recommend the following three month installation methodology:
<p>
<b>Month 1: <i>Getting Started with Internal Data</i></b>
<p>
The major objective in the first month is to define and load a subset
of your internal data so that portfolio managers can view their own
portfolios via their browser.  This month includes defining the
process for extracting the basic data sets from internal systems
and manually loading the data into your Vision environment.  The
initial data sets should include security, portfolio, and company
masters, holdings data, and supplemental data such as industry and
sector.  The recommended starter feeds are
<a href="#feeds">described in detail below</a>.  These feeds
provide enough information to use most of the starter portfolio reports
without modification.  
<p>
<b>Month 2: <i>Basic Report Customizations and Additional Data</i></b>
<p>
The major objective in the second month is to incorporate links to some
external data feeds, tailor existing applications to meet your
needs, and introduce one or two custom reports.  By
the end of this month, we should have a complete functional system
that includes all the initial data feeds and applications you require
for rollout.
<p>
<b>Month 3: <i>Productionization</i></b>
<p>
The major objective in the third month is to productionize the data
upload process, address cusip/sedol change and split adjustment issues,
and define exception reporting and data error resolution strategies.
Part of this month is used to define a process that best fits into your
organization's current operating environment.
By the end of this month, we should have procedures in place that
enable you to manage the day-to-day operation of your Vision system.

<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="nextsteps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>
Congratulations, you now have a system in production and many happy
users.  Over time, you will probably want to add new reports and
expand the set of internal and external data feeds you incorporate.
You will be able to do many of these enhancements on your own using
the techniques you learned during the installation process.  Insyte's
consultants are available to design, develop, and install
additional applications
with you.  At this point you may choose to begin learning the Vision
language so that you can develop new reports and applications on your
own.  General Vision language training is available if and when you
decide to embark on this path.

about "next steps" <a href="pmaNextSteps.htm">is available</a>.


<p>
<hr>
<h2 id="feeds">Starter Feeds</h2>
<p>

To initialize your Vision database, you will minimally want to supply
the following feeds:
<p>
  <center>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2>
	<tr>
	  <th>Feed<th>Recommended Fields
	</tr>
      <tr>
	<td><a href="pma_CompanyMaster.htm"><b>CompanyMaster</b></a>
	<td><i>entityId</i>, <i>name</i>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td><a href="pma_SecurityMaster.htm"><b>SecurityMaster</b></a>
	<td><i>entityId</i>, <i>name</i>, <i>ticker</i>, <i>companyId</i>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td><a href="pma_PortfolioMaster.htm"><b>PortfolioMaster</b></a>
	<td><i>entityId</i>, <i>name</i>
      </tr>
      <tr>
	<td><a href="pma_HoldingsFeed.htm"><b>HoldingsFeed</b></a>
	<td><i>acctId</i>, <i>secId</i>, <i>date</i>, <i>shares</i>, <i>mval</i>
      </tr>
    </table>
  </center>
<p>
You should supply one or more tab-delimited files for each of these feeds.
<p>
<b>Hints:</b>
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Any security referenced in your <b>HoldingsFeed</b> should be included
in your <b>SecurityMaster</b>.  Any number of additional securities can
be included.
<p>
<li>If you do not have a <b>CompanyMaster</b>, use your <b>SecurityMaster</b>
for both feeds.
</ul>
<p><hr align=center width=70%><p>
<h4>Consideration: Multiple Asset Types</h4>
<p>
<b>Question:</b>
<ul>
What types of assets are included in your <b>HoldingsFeed</b>?:
</ul>
<p>
<b>Answer: </b>
<i>Only equity holdings are included (i.e., no cash or other asset types)</i>
<ul>
You are all set.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Answer: </b>
<i>Holdings include equity plus cash</i>
<ul>
You have several options:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>use the string <i>CashUS</i> as the value of <i>secId</i> in the
<b>HoldingsFeed</b> to indicate a cash holding.
<li>identify aliases that are used to indicate a cash holding in the
<b>HoldingsFeed</b> and add them to the <i>CashUS</i> security using
the <a href="pma_SecurityAliases.htm"><b>SecurityAliases</b></a> feed.
<li>use general multiple asset type rules, described below.
</ul></ul>
<p>
<b>Answer: </b>
<i>Holdings potentially include multiple asset types</i>
<ul>
You need to add a security type indicator for the securities in your 
master.  You should:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>supply the
<a href="pma_SecurityTypeMaster.htm"><b>SecurityTypeMaster</b></a>
feed with the fields <i>entityId</i>, <i>name</i>, and <i>assetCategory</i>.
<li>add the field <i>type</i> to your <b>SecurityMaster</b> with values that
correspond to the security types you have defined.
</ul>
<p>
</ul>

<p><hr align=center width=70%><p>
<h4>Considerations: International Security Universe</h4>
<p>
<b>Question:</b>
<ul>
Does your universe include international companies? 
Do you want to be able to present US information in foreign currencies?
</ul>
<p>
<b>Answer: </b> <i>Yes</i>
<ul>
You should consider adding country and currency information
to your database.  This requires that you:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>supply a 
<a href="pma_CurrencyMaster.htm"><b>CurrencyMaster</b></a> feed with the
fields <i>entityId</i> and <i>name</i>; a sample feed is available.
<li>add the field <i>currencyId</i> to the <b>SecurityMaster</b>
feed with values that correspond to the currencies in your master.
<li>supply an 
<a href="pma_ExchangeRateFeed.htm"><b>ExchangeRateFeed</b></a> feed with the
fields <i>entityId</i>, <i>date</i>, and <i>usExchange</i>.
<li>supply a 
<a href="pma_CountryMaster.htm"><b>CountryMaster</b></a> feed with the
fields <i>entityId</i>, <i>name</i>, and <i>currencyId</i>;
a sample feed is available.

<li>supply a 
<a href=pma_CompanyToCountry.htm"><b>CompanyToCountry</b></a> feed 
to map your companies to their countries.
</ul></ul>

<p><hr align=center width=70%><p>
<h4>Considerations: Industry Scheme</h4>
<p>
<b>Question:</b>
<ul>
Do you want to be able to see your data grouped into industries and sectors?
</ul>
<p>
<b>Answer: </b> <i>Yes</i>
<ul>
You should consider adding industry and sector information
to your database.  This requires that you:
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>supply the
<a href="pma_SectorMaster.htm"><b>SectorMaster</b></a> and
<a href="pma_IndustryMaster.htm"><b>IndustryMaster</b></a> 
feeds with the fields
<i>entityId</i> and <i>name</i>.
<li>supply the
