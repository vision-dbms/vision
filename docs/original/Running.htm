<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>
Before you run Vision, a number of configuration options may need to
be set to define your environment.  If you have problems starting
and executing the examples in this section, you should ask your
Vision Administrator to check your configuration</a>.
<p>
To connect to your Vision database, you run the <i>batchvision</i>
program.  Type:<pre><tt><b>
     batchvision
</b></tt></pre>
This starts up Vision without a "front-end".  You should
see the prompt <i>V> </i>.  At this point, you can enter a Vision
request.  A request can be any 
<a href="Program.htm">Vision program</a> ranging from simple
calculations to complex procedures.  A request must be terminated by
the characters <b>?g</b> on a single line followed by a carriage
return.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     <i>V> </i>2 + 2
     <i>V> </i>?g
</b></tt></pre>
produces:<pre><tt><b>
          4.00
     <i>V> </i>
</b></tt></pre>
Vision requests can span multiple lines.  Each time you enter a
carriage return character, you will see another <i>V> </i> prompt.
The <b>?g</b> command is your indication to Vision that you are done
entering your request.  Vision will then execute your request and
display any results.  You will then see another <i>V> </i> prompt
indicating that Vision is ready for another request.
<p>
To exit, type <i>Ctrl-D</i> or <i>QUIT</i> followed by a carriage
return.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="editor">Interactive Vision Sessions</a></h3>
<p>
Although you can use the <i>batchvision</i> program interactively,
there are no editing tools defined in this mode of operation
other than those available via your operating's system command line
shell.  For interactive program development and execution, it is
more useful to interact with Vision via an editor that communicates
with the <i>batchvision</i> program.
<p>
Insyte provides a <i>vt100</i>-based editor and a
<i>Windows</i>-based editor for interacting with the
<i>batchvision</i> program.  Both editors are designed to
keep track of your entire session's interactions, enabling you
to develop and test your programs incrementally.
Both of these Editors provide an
<b>Edit Window</b> which is used to compose
your Vision programs.  You can create new programs, recall earlier
programs developed during this session, and load prestored programs
from files into the Edit Window.  The <b>Output Window</b> is used
to display the results of running your Vision program.  
<p>
You can also hook up many common
editors such as <i>emacs</i> and <i>vi</i> to a
<i>batchvision</i> session via the macro facilities available with
these programs.
<p>
<h4><a name="vt100">The <i>vt100</i>-based Editor</a></h4>
<p>
The <i>vt100</i>-based editor can be used in environments that house
the Vision database on a Unix machine.  It can be used to access Vision from
Unix or Windows workstations.  Your display should be simulating a
<i>vt100</i> style terminal and your <i>TERM</i> environment
variable should be set to <i>vt100</i>.  
<p>
To start Vision with this editor, log into the Unix environment
and enter:<pre><tt><b>
     vision
</b></tt></pre>
Once the editor is displayed, you can enter any
Vision request.  To submit the request, press the <i>F2</i> function
key.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     2 + 2       </b><i># push the F2 key</i><b>
</b></tt></pre>
You should see the output:<pre><tt><b>
     Output:
          4.00
</b></tt></pre>
See the 
<a href="Editor.htm#vt100"><i>Vision vt100 Editor Summary</i></a>
for more information.
<p>
<h4><a name="session">The <i>Windows</i>-based Editor</a></h4>
<p>
The <i>Windows</i>-based editor can be used with Vision databases
housed on any hardware platform.  This interface is part of the
<a href="ifVLink.htm#concepts">VLink OLE Server</a> module and appears as the 
<i>Vision Session</i> icon in the <i>Team Vision</i> program group.
<p>
To start Vision, click the <i>Vision Session</i> icon.
Enter the display area at the top and enter a Vision request.
To submit the request, press the <i>Run</i> icon in the middle of the
tool bar or select <i>Session / Submit</i> from the menu bar.
For example:<pre><tt><b>
     2 + 2       </b><i># push the Run icon</i><b>
</b></tt></pre>
You should see the output:<pre><tt><b>
          4.00
</b></tt></pre>
in the Output Window.
<p>
See the 
<a href="Editor.htm#windows"><i>Vision Windows Editor Summary</i></a>
for more information.
<p>

<h3><a name="batch">Batch Processing</a></h3>
<p>
The <i>batchvision</i> program can also be used to execute
non-interactive programs.  Requests can be submitted to
<i>batchvision</i> by creating command files.  A command file is
simply a standard text file containing one or more Vision requests.
Any number of requests can be included in a command file.  Each
request is terminated by the <b>?g</b> command which instructs
Vision to begin executing the request.
<p>
For example, assume the message <i>displayWeeklyReports</i> has been
saved in the Vision database and you want to run this program.  You
could create the file <i>testfile</i> which contains the following
lines:<pre><tt><b>
     displayWeeklyReports
     ?g
</b></tt></pre>
To execute this command file, it can be used as standard input to the 
<i>batchvision</i> program as shown below:<pre><tt><b>
     batchvision < testfile
</b></tt></pre>
The requests in a command file can access, create, and manipulate
any Vision structures that have been saved in the database or defined
in the command file.
<p>
The output from non-interactive program execution can be redirected
to any device or output file and the execution can be started as a
background process.  Exact conventions will vary depending on your
operating system and "shell".  In Unix C-shell for example, the
output of this command can be saved in the file <i>testfile.out</i>
and the entire process executed in background using the following:<pre><tt><b>
     batchvision < testfile >& testfile.out &
</b></tt></pre>
<p>

<h3><a name="ospace">Object Spaces</a></h3>
<p>
Your Vision database contains the objects, data, and navigation
rules needed to integrate, access, manipulate, and update
information.
The database consists of a network of interconnected 
<b>Object Spaces</b>
that correspond to directories for storing the data, structures, and
protocol associated with a particular portion of the database.  Each Object 
Space consists of a set of <b>Segments</b>
that correspond to the actual files that contain information.
The object spaces and segments are all related and managed through a single
network controller
file known as the <b>NDF</b> (Network Directory File).
These components of your Vision database are described in detail in the
<a href="admNet.htm"><i>Vision Administration</i></a> document.
<p>
Object spaces are numbered consecutively from 1.  
A Vision database is minimally configured to contain three object spaces.
Space 1 contains kernel Vision structures.
Space 2 is used to store the protocol for built-in classes such as
<i>Number</i>, <i>List</i>, and <i>TimeSeries</i> .
Space 3 is used to store core
application classes and their messages.  The information in these
spaces is directly accessible to all Vision users.
<p>
Additional object spaces are created as needed to organize functional 
components of the Vision network that do not need to be fully 
visible to all users.  New object spaces are assigned the next
available number when created.  You normally do not need to know
which object space houses the specific information being requested,
since messages encapsulate these navigations for you.
<p>
When a Vision session is started, a 
<a name="top"><b>Top-Level Object Space</b></a> can
be specified explicitly.  If no space is specified, a 
<b>Temporary Work Space</b> is created as your top-level environment.
When you start Vision without any special
options, you are accessing this temporary work space.  
<p>
All Vision object spaces including the temporary work space
automatically have access to the information stored in spaces
2 and 3.  When a Vision expression is executed, Vision searches the
user's top-level
space first, followed by object space 3, then object space 2 to
locate any top-level messages that have been sent.  The message is
resolved at the first place it is found.  This message search path is
illustrated below:<pre><tt>
              top-level space       (temporary or explicit object space)
                    |
                    |
                    V
              object space 3        (shared application core)
                    |
                    |
                    V
              object space 2        (shared built-in core)
</tt></pre>
<p>
For example, the selector <i>Company</i>
could be defined as a message in object space 3 that
returns the default instance of the class Company.  When the Vision
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Company
</b></tt></pre>
is executed, the default company is returned.  If you execute the
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     !Company <- 10 ;
</b></tt></pre>
the selector <i>Company</i> is temporarily created in your
top-level space.  When the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Company
</b></tt></pre>
is executed in this session, it
will return the number 10, since Vision finds this definition first.
To access the original, "shared" definition
of <i>Company</i>, you would use the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     super Company
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
To display all the messages defined in the top-level space, 
use:<pre><tt><b>
     displayMessages
</b></tt></pre>
Note that if you started your session with an explicit object space number,
this request displays all the messages that have been defined for
that object space, in addition to any new messages that have been
defined in this session.
<p>
To display all the messages that are defined in object space 3, 
use the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     super displayMessages
</b></tt></pre>
and to display all the messages that are defined in object space 2,
use the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     super super displayMessages
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
The magic word <a href="Execution.htm#global"><i>^global</i></a>
is used to access your top-level from within a Vision program.  
For example:<pre><tt><b>
     object 
     do: [ #---  misc messages to object
           ^global displayMessages;
         ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
displays all the messages defined for your top-level space,
independent of the object with which you are working.  The message
<i>CoreWorkspace</i> will always return the top-level of object space 3
independent of your top-level starting point.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     object 
     do: [ #---  misc messages to object
           ^global CoreWorkspace displayMessages;
         ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
displays all the messages defined for the top-level of object space 3.
<p>
More information about <a href="Execution.htm">resolving messages</a> 
is available.

<h3><a name="option">Startup Options</a></h3>
<p>
There are several command line options that can be used when
you start the <i>batchvision</i> program. 
These options are described in detail in the document 
<a href="admNet.htm"><i>Vision Administration</i></a>.
Some of the frequently used options are described below.
<p>
To run Vision with a database other than the default database, you
must specify the <a href="#ospace">NDF</a> of the database you wish to use. 
The <b>-n</b> option can be used to specify a
different NDF.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     batchvision -n /newvision/network/NDF
</b></tt></pre>
This opens up the database managed by the NDF located in the
<i>/newvision/network</i> directory.  Alternatively, you can set the
<i>NDFPathName</i> environment variable to point to this NDF file.
In Unix:<pre><tt><b>
     setenv NDFPathName /newvision/network/NDF
     batchvision
</b></tt></pre>
is equivalent to starting Vision with the <b>-n</b> option.
<p>
To start Vision with a specific <a href="#top">top-level space</a>,
you can use the
<b>-U#</b> to specify the object space number to use as your global
environment.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     batchvision -U10
</b></tt></pre>
starts Vision with object space 10 as your global environment.
Alternatively, you can set the
<i>UserOSI</i> environment variable to point to this object space
number.  In Unix:<pre><tt><b>
     setenv UserOSI 10
     batchvision
</b></tt></pre>
is equivalent to starting Vision with the <b>-U10</b> option.
<p>
To run Vision with a startup expression, you can use the <b>-x</b> option
to specify a startup string.  Vision will execute this expression
when your session begins.  For example, if you always want Vision
to create a new class named <i>MyClass</i>, you can start Vision 
using:<pre><tt><b>
     batchvision -x 'Entity createSubclass: "MyClass"; '
</b></tt></pre>
Note that if your startup expression generates terminal
output and you are using a Vision Editor, the output will not be
displayed.  This technique can be used to read and evaluate a file
containing Vision code.  
<a name="include">For example,</a> 
if the file <i>include.v</i> contains
Vision code, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     batchvision -x ' "include.v" asFileContents evaluate; '
</b></tt></pre>
can be used to read and execute the Vision code in this file at startup.  
The environment variable <i>VisionStartExpr</i> can be used as an
alternative to the <b>-x</b> option.
<p>

<h3><a name="qcommand">? Commands</a></h3>
<p>
In <i>batchvision</i>, text is collected into a buffer until you
type a <b><font size=+1>? </font></b> command on its own line.  For
example, the <b>?g</b> command indicates that the current text
buffer should be executed.  When you are using one of the Vision
Editors, you do not explicitly need to type this command.
<p>
The following <b><font size=+1>? </font></b> commands are
recognized by <i>batchvision:</i>
<p>
<Center><table WIDTH="500" TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="8">
<tr>
<td><b>? Command</b></td>
<td><b>Definition</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><b>?c</b></td>
<td>Check syntax of current request</td>
<tr>
<td><b>?e</b></td>
<td>Toggle echoing of input - off by default</td>
<tr>
<td><b>?f</b></td>
<td>Flush any input since the last <b>?g</b> command.
<tr>
<td><b>?g</b></td>
<td>Execute any input since the last <b>?g</b> command.
<tr>
<td><b>?l</b></td>
<td>Rerun the last request.
<tr>
<td><b>?r<i>[count]</i></b></td>
<td>Run current request <i>[count]</i> times
<tr>
<td><b>?s</b></td>
<td>Display request in progress.
<tr>
<td><b>?S</b></td>
<td>Display last request executed with <b>?g</b> command.
<tr>
<td><b>?t</b></td>
<td>Display timing of last <b>?g</b> command.
<tr>
<td><b>?? <i>filename</i></b></td>
<td>Read in the file <i>filename</i>.  Note that this functionality has
been replaced by the
<a href="Input.htm#program"><i>asFileContents evaluate</i></a>
expression, but is still used in some scripts.

</tr></table></Center>

<p>
Note that <b><font size=+1>? </font></b> commands must appear on
their own line.  The first character in the line must be the
<b><font size=+1>? </font></b>.
