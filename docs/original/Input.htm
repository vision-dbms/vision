<h3 id="file">Reading Files</h3>
<p>
The <i>asFileContents</i> message can be sent to a <i>String</i>
representing the name of a file and returns the contents of the
file as a <i>String</i>.  For example:<pre><b>
     "myFile" asFileContents
</b></pre>
opens the file <i>myFile</i> and returns its contents as a string.
Since this program is not terminated with a ';' character, the
contents of the file will print by default.  You could save the
contents of the file into a variable.  For example:<pre><b>
     !fileContents <- "myFile" asFileContents ;
     fileContents count printNL ;
</b></pre>
This program stores the contents of the file <i>myFile</i> into the
variable <i>fileContents</i>.  The second statement in this program
displays the number of characters in the file.
<p>
There are two primary reasons for reading a file into Vision:
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="#program">
The file contains Vision program code which you want to read and
execute.</a>
<li><a href="#data">
The file contains information which needs to be parsed and stored
in properties of other Vision objects.</a>
</ol>
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="program">Loading Programs</h3>
<p>
It is often useful to save methods and other Vision programs in files
outside the Vision database.  You can interactively load these files
by reading them into a Vision editor and executing the request;
however, it is also useful to be able to read in files of code as part of a
program.  You can use the <i>asFileContents evaluate</i> expression
to do this.  For example, if the file <i>sampleCode</i> contains the
Vision code:<pre><b>
     !x <- 3 ;
     !y <- 10 ;
</b></pre>
and you execute:<pre><b>
     "sampleCode" asFileContents evaluate; 
     x print ; y print ;
</b></pre>
you will see the values of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> displayed.  The
first statement in this program will read in the file and evaluate
its contents as though you had entered the code directly.  After the
file contents have been evaluated, you have access to the variables
<i>x</i> and <i>y</i> defined in this file.
<p>
By default, the code in your file will be evaluated as though
you typed it into your top-level workspace.  You can also execute
code in the context of a particular object.
For example, if the file <i>sampleCode</i> contains the
Vision code:<pre><b>
     "This object is an instance of class " print; 
     whatAmI printNL ;
</b></pre>
and you execute:<pre><b>
     "sampleCode" asFileContents evaluateIn: 3 ;
</b></pre>
You should see:<pre><b>
     This object is an instance of class Integer
</b></pre>
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="data">Loading Data Files</h3>
<p>
The string returned by the <i>asFileContents</i> message can be viewed
as a data file. Each line of the data file can be thought of as a record.  
Each record consists of one or more fields.  The fields in the record
can be in a fixed format or delimited by a specific character.
In a fixed format, each field occupies the same character
positions from record to record.  In a delimited format, fields are
separated by a known character so the position of a specific field
relative to its record will vary from record to record.
<p>
For example, in a fixed field format, you could have a security id
in positions 1 - 6 , a name in positions 7 - 36, and a price in
positions 37 - 46 as illustrated below:<pre><b>
     IBM   International Business Mach      123.500
     GM    General Motors                    33.125
     XON   Exxon Corp                       111.000
</b></pre>
The same data in a comma delimited format would look like:<pre><b>
     IBM, International Business Mach, 123.500
     GM, General Motors, 33.125
     XON, Exxon Corp, 111.000
</b></pre>
In the fixed field format, each field starts at a
known character position in the record and has a fixed size.  Field
values that require fewer characters are blank-padded to fit into
the fixed field size.  In the delimited format, the blanks between
the fields are optional (unless the blank is the delimiter).
The selected delimiter should not be a character that can be used
within a field.  The "tab" (ctrl I) character is often used as the
delimiter for this reason.
<p>
The <i>asLines</i> message is used to divide the string returned
by the <i>asFileContents</i> message into a 
list of strings, using the carriage-return character
as a delimiter.  For example:<pre><b>
   #-- create string containing the file name, including its path.
   !fileName <- "/users/xyz/dir1/file.txt" ;

   #--  extract contents of file as a single, large string.
   !theFile <- fileName asFileContents ;

   #--  convert the file into a list of records 
   #--  each element of record is a single string
   !records <- theFile asLines ;
   records count printNL ;
</b></pre>
<p>
The variable <i>records</i> returns a list of string objects where
each element of the list corresponds to a record in the original file.
This record can then be divided into its fields
based on position or delimiter character.  Each field is a
string by default.  The field value can be converted to other data
types such as number.
<p id="readFixed.samp">
The following Vision code can be used to break fixed format records into 
fields:<pre><b>
   #--  break each record into its fields - fixed format approach
   !xrecords <- records
     extendBy: [ !securityId <- ^self take: 6 . stripBoundingBlanks ;
                 !name <- ^self from: 7 for: 30 . stripBoundingBlanks ; 
                 !price <- ^self from: 37 to: 47 . asNumber ;
               ] ;
</b></pre>
The variable <i>xrecords</i> returns the list of records extended
by three additional variables representing the fields in the record.
The <i>securityId</i> variable is defined as the first 6 characters of
the record.  The <i>name</i> variable is defined as a 30 character
string starting at position 7 in the record.  Blanks at the start
and end of these fields are removed.  The <i>price</i>
variable is defined as the field from position 37 to 47 in the
record and is converted to a number.
<p id="readDelimited.samp">
The following Vision code can be used to break comma-delimited records 
into fields:<pre><b>
   #--  break each record into its fields - comma-delimited approach
   !xrecords <- records
      extendBy: [ !fields <- ^self breakOn: "," ;     # break on delimiter 
                  !securityId <- fields at: 1 . stripBoundingBlanks ;
                  !name <- fields at: 2 . stripBoundingBlanks ;
                  !price <- fields at: 3 . asNumber ;
                ] ;
</b></pre>
The <a href="mString.htm#breakOn:"><i>breakOn:</i></a> message is
used to break the record into fields based on one or more delimiter
characters and returns a list of strings.
The <i>securityId</i>, <i>name</i>, and <i>price</i> variables are
defined as the first, second, and third elements of this list.
<p>
The information in these records can be used to update properties
of other objects.  
Field values are often used as a "key" for another structure.  For
example, the <i>securityId</i> can be used to reference a
specific instance of a Security class.
Assume the class Security had defined the
properties <i>name</i> and <i>price</i>.
<span id="update.samp"> </span
The following Vision code could be used to update these properties
using the data read from the file:<pre><b>
   #--  use each record to update name and price properties of Security
   xrecords
   do: [ !security <- ^global Named Security at: securityId ;
         security isntNA
         ifTrue:
           [ security :name <- name ;
             security :price <- price ;
           ] 
         ifFalse:
           [ securityId print ; " Not Found." printNL ;
           ] ;
        ] ;
</b></pre>
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="more">Additional String Parsing Techniques</h3>
<p>
There are many additional messages defined at String which are useful
for parsing data files.  
<p>
The <a href="mString.htm#asRecords"><i>asRecords</i></a> message 
combines the <i>asFileContents</i> and <i>asLines</i> steps.  The
expression: <pre><b>
     "sampleCode" asRecords
</b></pre>
is the same as:<pre><b>     "sampleCode" asFileContents asLines
</b></pre>
<p>
The <a href="mString.htm#asCSVRecords"><i>asCSVRecords</i></a> message 
can be used to convert
a <i>comma-separated-value</i> format file to a list
of strings extended by the message <i>fields</i>.
Embedded commas in the original file are preserved.  
For example, if the file <i>sample.csv</i> contains:<pre><b>
     key1,description1,value1
     key2,"description 2 with , character",value2
</b></pre>
then:<pre><b>
     "sample.csv" asCSVRecords
     do: [ "Field 1: " print ; fields at: 1 . printNL ;
           "Field 2: " print ; fields at: 2 . printNL ;
           "Field 3: " print ; fields at: 3 . printNL ;
         ] ;
</b></pre>
displays:<pre><b>
     Field 1: key1
     Field 2: description1
     Field 3: value1
     Field 1: key2
     Field 2: description 2 with , character
     Field 3: value2
</b></pre>
<p>
Several messages are available for filtering the characters from the
input file.  
The message <a href="mString.htm#stripChar:"><i>stripChar:</i></a> is used to
return the recipient string with the supplied character removed for
every occurrence.
The message <a href="mString.htm#translate:to:">
<i>translate:to:</i></a> is used to replace all occurrences of the
character in the first parameter with the string supplied in the
second parameter.  For example:<pre><b>
     "sampleCode" asFileContents
         stripChar: "+" . translate: "*" to: " " . 
</b></pre>
removes all the '+' characters from the string and changes all
occurrences of the '*' character to a blank.
<p id="format">
In some <a href="#readFixed.samp">earlier examples</a>, you have seen
several techniques used for parsing the data fields and converting
the values to different types.  In the expression:<pre><b>
     !securityId <- ^self take: 6 ;
</b></pre>
the message <a href="mString.htm#take:"><i>take:</i></a> is used to
extract the first 6 characters of the string.  This message can be
used in conjunction with
the message <a href="mString.htm#drop:"><i>drop:</i></a> which 
eliminates characters from the start or end of the string.  For
example, if the name field starts in position 7 for 30 characters,
the field could be extracted using:<pre><b>
     !name <- ^self drop: 6 . take: 30 ;
</b></pre>
The messages <a href="mString.htm#from:for:"><i>from:for:</i></a> 
and <a href="mString.htm#from:to:"><i>from:to:</i></a> provides
alternative ways to do the same thing.  For example:<pre><b>
     !alt1 <- ^self from: 7 for: 30 ;
     !alt2 <- ^self from: 7 to: 36 ;
</b></pre>
The messages <a href="mString.htm#from:"><i>from:</i></a> and
<a href="mString.htm#to:"><i>to:</i></a> are variations on
the <i>from:to:</i> message.  When the supplied parameter is a number,
<i>from:</i> returns the string starting at this position to the end of
the string and <i>to:</i> returns the string from position 1 to the
supplied position.  The supplied parameter can also be a single character.
In this case, <i>from:</i> returns the string starting with the first
occurrence of this character and <i>to:</i> returns the string ending
with the first occurrence of this character.
<p>
The message <a href="mString.htm#stripBoundingBlanks">
<i>stripBoundingBlanks</i></a> is used to eliminate blank
characters from either end of a string.  For example:<pre><b>
     !alt3 <- ^self from: 7 for: 30 . stripBoundingBlanks ;
</b></pre>
<p>
The expression:<pre><b>
     !price <- ^self from: 37 to: 47 . asNumber ;
</b></pre>
uses the message <a href="mString.htm#asNumber"><i>asNumber</i></a>
to convert the string value to a numeric value.  The message
<a href="mString.htm#convertToNumber"><i>convertToNumber</i></a>,
converts a string containing commas to a numeric value.  Both of
these messages return <i>NA</i> if the string cannot be converted
to a number.
<p>
Several messages are available for converting integer to dates.
The message
<a href="mString.htm#asDate"><i>asDate</i></a> converts an integer
in the form <i>CCYYMMDD</i>, <i>YYMMDD</i>, <i>YYMM</i>, 
or <i>YY</i> into a date where <i>CC</i> is the century,
<i>YY</i> is the year, <i>MM</i> is the month, and <i>DD</i>
is the day.  For example:<pre><b>
     !priceDate <- ^self from: 48 for: 10 . asNumber asInteger asDate ;
</b></pre>
If the field starting at position 48 for 10 characters contained 
"&nbsp&nbsp 960515 &nbsp&nbsp", 
the variable <i>priceDate</i> would be set to the date
May 15, 1996.  Several other variations of the <i>asDate</i> message
have been defined including:
<a href="mInteger.htm#asDateFromMMDD"><i>asDateFromMMDD</i></a>,
<a href="mInteger.htm#asDateFromMMDDYY"><i>asDateFromMMDDYY</i></a>,
<a href="mInteger.htm#asDateFromMMDDYYYY"><i>asDateFromMMDDYYYY</i></a>,
<a href="mInteger.htm#asDateFromMMYY"><i>asDateFromMMYY</i></a>,
<a href="mInteger.htm#asDateFromYYMMDD"><i>asDateFromYYMMDD</i></a>, and
<a href="mInteger.htm#asDateFromYYYYMM"><i>asDateFromYYYYMM</i></a>.
<p>
The message <a href="mObject.htm#else:"><i>else:</i></a> 
is useful for assigning default values when a field does not convert
as expected.  For example:<pre><b>
     !price <- ^self from: 37 to: 47 . asNumber else: 0.0 ;
</b></pre>
returns the value <i>0.0</i> if the field cannot be converted to a numeric
value (i.e., the <i>asNumber</i> message returns an NA) and<pre><b>
     !priceDate <- ^self from: 48 for: 10 . 
        asNumber asInteger asDate else: ^today ;
</b></pre>
returns the value <i>^today</i> if the field cannot be converted to a
date (i.e., the <i>asDate</i> message returns an NA).

<h3 id="adv">Memory Resources and Advanced Data Loading Techniques</h3>

<h4 id="adv_mem">Private Memory and String Structures</h4>
<p>
The amount of private memory allocated at any point in your Vision session for temporary
and permanent structures can be displayed using the following query:<pre><b>
     AdminTools totalNetworkAllocation
</pre></b>
For example, if you executed the above as the first query after starting a new session
you would get a baseline (<i>per process</i>) memory allocation, in bytes, for your
Vision database.  You can monitor private memory usage after loading a data file or at
any point in your sequence of queries. If the amount of memory allocated exceeds what you
would expect, it might be useful to review the data load code and optimize it if possible.
This is particularly useful if the number of files you expect to load exceeds 3 or 4 or
if you load the same file many times in your Vision session without exiting.
<p>
Temporary structures remain in memory for the duration of the Vision session if they are
referenced by global variables.  In the previous sections, the variable <i>fileContents</i>
or <i>theFile</i> is used to save the contents of a file as a string. The subsequent
conversion of this string into lines (also strings), stored as the variable <i>records</i>,
and the parsing of each record into individual field variables, accessed by the variable
<i>xrecords</i> and its extended properties, increases the private memory allocation
as new strings are created.
<p>
If the strings and variables referencing them were created in a method block, following
execution of the block these temporary structures would no longer be resident in memory
provided that no references to them existed from permanent structures in the database.
As properties are updated or new instances are created using these string field values,
permanent references are made to these strings and the structures remain in memory.
<p>
The amount of memory used to store these permanently referenced strings depends on how the
strings are created.  Strings are stored in <a href="Classes.htm#cluster"<i>clusters</i></a>
or <i>stores</i>, as are all classes and their instances.  Since the String class is
a <i>Built-in</i> class, new strings do not get added to its default cluster.  The Vision
expression:<pre><b>
     String instanceList count
</pre></b>
will always return a value of 1.
<p>
The variables created to reference strings actually represent the newly created string
clusters. For example:
<pre><b>
     !theFile <- "myFile" asFileContents ;
     theFile instanceList count
</pre></b>
will return a value of 1 since the entire file is returned as a single string object.
The subsequent conversion of the single string into a list of strings creates another
string cluster:<pre><b>
     !records <- theFile asLines;
</pre></b>
The variable <i>records</i> returns a <i>List</i> object which contains references to the
new strings, and the Vision query:<pre><b>
     records count
</pre></b>
returns the number of elements in the list.  To access the new string cluster, you need
to access any element of the list; for example:<pre><b>
     records at: 1 . instanceList count
</pre></b>
will return the number of strings in the new cluster.
<p>
The size of each string cluster (number of characters) can be obtained using the Vision
code:<pre><b>
     #-- single string
     theFile count printNL;

     #-- list of strings
     records at: 1 . instanceList total: [ count ] . printNL;
</pre></b>
<p>
The final parsing of each string into its respective field items using a fixed field
input file:<pre><b>
   !xrecords <- records
     extendBy: [ !securityId <- ^self take: 6 . stripBoundingBlanks ;
                 !name <- ^self from: 7 for: 30 . stripBoundingBlanks ; 
                 !price <- ^self from: 37 to: 47 . asNumber ;
               ] ;
</pre></b>
creates a new string cluster for each property that is not further converted into another
type. Each string cluster contains the same number of strings as there are records in the
input file.
<p>
For a comma-delimited input file, the final parsing of each string into its field
items using the form:<pre><b>
   !xrecords <- records
      extendBy: [ !fields <- ^self breakOn: "," ;     # break on delimiter 
                  !securityId <- fields at: 1 . stripBoundingBlanks ;
                  !name <- fields at: 2 . stripBoundingBlanks ;
                  !price <- fields at: 3 . asNumber ;
                ] ;
</pre></b>
could potentially create references to string clusters containing more than just the
strings associated with a given field.  The <i>breakOn:</i> message breaks the string
record into fields based on one or more delimiter characters and returns a list of strings.
The variable <i>fields</i> references a new string cluster which contains all strings
for all records.  The <i>securityId</i> and <i>name</i> variables would reference the same
string cluster as <i>fields</i> if there were no blanks that needed to be stripped since
the original string would have been returned by the method.  A new string cluster would
have been created if blanks were indeed stripped, containing just the strings for the single
field item.
<p>
Subsequent use of these strings to update or create permanent structures:<pre><b>
   xrecords
   do: [ !security <- ^global Named Security at: securityId ;
          security isNA
            ifTrue: [ :security <- ^global Security createInstance: securityId ] ;
          security name != name
            ifTrue: [ security :name <- name ] ;
          security :price <- price ;
        ] ;
</pre></b>
results in permanent references to string clusters that can contain minimally string
values for a given field or in the worst case, all strings in the original input file.
<p>
A simple technique to disassociate the strings representing field values from the
cluster referenced by the field item is to create a copy of each string at the
point where it is to be used to update a property in a permanent object.  The
above code would need to be revised as follows:<pre><b>
   xrecords
   do: [ !security <- ^global Named Security at: securityId ;
          security isNA
            ifTrue: [ :security <- ^global Security
                        createInstance: securityId copyString #<--- update code
                    ] ;
          security name != name
            ifTrue: [ security :name <- name copyString ] ;   #<--- update name
          security :price <- price ;
        ] ;
</pre></b>
The resultant string cluster representing a property value would only include those
strings which were actually used to update the property.  For example, if a data
file contained 2,000 records with 2 string fields and if only 20 new securities were
created while 40 existing securities had their name refreshed, the new string cluster
created for the <i>code</i> property value would have only 20 strings and the new string
cluster for the <i>name</i> property value would have 60 strings.  Without creating a copy
of the strings as needed, both the <i>code</i> and <i>name</i> string clusters would
minimally contain 2,000 strings using the fixed field format parser.  For the comma-delimited
format parser, the two properties could potentially reference a single cluster containing
4,000 strings.
<p>
For installations that may not yet have the method <i>copyString</i> available, the
following code needs to be executed at the start of an interactive session or committed
permanently in the database:<pre><b>
   String
   defineMethod: [ | copyString |
     ^self asSelf drop: 0
   ] ;
</pre></b>
Messages that manipulate string content, such as <i>take:</i>, <i>drop:</i>, <i>concat:</i>,
all return a modified copy of the recipient string.  In this case, nothing is changed in the
recipient string, only a new copy of the string is returned.
<p>
Another technique to further decrease the amount of memory needed to load data would be
to omit creating references to intermediate string clusters:<pre><b>
   !xrecords <- "myFile" asFileContents asLines
     extendBy: [ . . .
                 . . .
               ] ;
</pre></b>
In the above revision, the intermediate reference to the single string representing
the data file does not remain and only the string cluster created by <i>asLines</i>
and referenced by <i>xrecords</i> remains in memory as long as the Vision session is
active.
<p>
As mentioned earlier, globally referenced string clusters remain in private memory.
To optimize private memory usage when loading data, methods should be defined to
process the data load so that following execution any unreferenced temporary variables
or string clusters are no longer resident in memory.
<p>
<h4 id="adv_batch">Batch Loads</h4>
<p>
The message <i>asFileContents</i> is suitable for loading data from files that
are relatively small, on the order of 5-30 MB, consisting of a single file or
at most several files.  As the size of the input file increases or the number of files
needed to complete the data load increase, memory resources (usually swap) become a limiting
factor and the load may not always succeed.
<p>
For single files greater than 30 MB, memory resources can be optimized if the file
is read and processed in batches rather than in its entirety.  The technique
described below requires a fixed field format and uses protocol of the
<a href="tkOpenVision.htm">Open Vision ToolKit</a>.
<p>
To <a href="tkOpenVision.htm#Accessing Files">access</a> a file with <b>read-only</b>
permission, use the message <i>asOpenVisionChannel</i> and supply <b>file</b> as the
<i>type</i> and the file name as the <i>resource</i> in its specification string.
Choose the appropriate <a href="tkOpenVision.htm#The Trim Format Option">trim format</a>
option, which controls the removal of leading and trailing blanks from strings.<pre><b>
     #-- create a string containing the file name
     !fileName <- "/users/xyz/dir1/file.txt" ;

     #-- open a channel to the file and set a trim format
     !file <- "file:" concat: fileName .
          asOpenVisionChannel
          setTrimFormatToTrailingBlanks ;
</b></pre>
To process the file in batches, you would supply a batch size (number of records to process
at a time) and calculate the file size, the record size, the number of records, and the
number of batches to process.  The following messages are sent to the <i>channel</i> object
that is stored in the variable <i>file</i>.
<p>
The message <i>byteCount</i> returns the size of the file, the message <i>getLine</i> returns
a string obtained by reading the next line from the channel, the message <i>getString:</i>
<b>size</b> <i>at:</i> <b>anOffset</b> returns a string containing the number of characters
specified by the size argument beginning at the offset position in the file, and the message
<i>close</i> closes the file.<pre><b>
     #-- get the file size
     !fileSize <- file byteCount ;

     #-- calculate the record size and number of records
     !recSize <- file getLine count ;
     !records <- (fileSize / recSize) asInteger ;

     #-- specify a batch (no. of records)
     !batchCount <- 1000 ;

     #-- calculate the batch size and the number of batches
     !batchSize <- batchCount * recSize ;
     !batches <- (records / batchCount + 1) asInteger ;

The Vision code below illustrates the iterative process of reading in a batch of
records, specified above, as a single string and parsing it using techniques described
earlier in this document:<pre><b>
     #-- batch numbers start with 0
     !firstBatch <- 0;
     !lastBatch <- (batches - 1) asInteger;

     #-- iterate over the batches
     batches sequence0
     iterate:
       [ !batchNum <- ^self;

         #-- get offset for current batch
         !offset <- (batchNum * ^my batchSize + 1) asInteger;

         #-- get size of current batch
         !bytesLeft <- ^my fileSize - offset + 1;
         !size <- ^my batchSize min: bytesLeft . max: 0 . asInteger ;

         #-- load current batch
         !string <- ^my file getString: size at: offset ;

         string count > 0 ifTrue:
          [ #-- parse records in current batch
            !xrecords <- string asLines
              extendBy:
                [ !id <- ^self take: 6 . stripBoundingBlanks ;
                  !name <- ^self from: 7 for: 30 . stripBoundingBlanks;
                    . . .
                ];
            #-- process records in current batch
            xrecords do:
              [ !security <- ^global Named Security at: id ;
                security isntNA ifTrue:
                  [ security :name <- name copyString;
                     . . .
                  ];
              ];
          ];
       ];  ## end iterate

     #-- close the file
     file close ;
</pre></b>
The batch sequence count begins with 0 in order to get the correct offset into the
file for the first iteration. The method <i>sequence0</i> when sent to an integer returns
a list of integers beginning with 0 and ending with 1 less than the recipient integer.
Each iteration returns a string of the expected size (<i>batchSize</i>) and the string is
converted into a list of records using the <i>asLines</i> method.  The batch size is bounded
by the amount of characters left to process since the last batch is not guaranteed to have
the full number of records as specified by the value of <i>batchCount</i>. A final check of
string size greater than 0 is added in the event that an empty string is returned.

<h4 id="adv_multi">Multiple File Loads</h4>
<p>
If data to be loaded is provided in separate files rather than in a single file, the
<a href="#adv_batch">batch load</a> technique may not be appropriate. In this
case, the standard load based on <i>asFileContents</i> can be further optimized with respect
to swap usage as described in the example below.
<p>
Assume the class Security has a time series property and a method to load monthly scores from a
data file.  The data file provides the id, name and score for a universe of securities for a
given date in comma delimited format.  The method creates new Security instances if they do not
exist in order to store the full score history.  In this example, data files to be processed range
in size from 1 to 2 MB and span dates from 8712 to 9709. The data is loaded using the following
Vision code:<pre><b>
   Security loadMonthlyScoresAsOf: 8712 fromFile: "score.8712" ;
   Security loadMonthlyScoresAsOf: 8801 fromFile: "score.8801" ;
    .
    .
    .
   Security loadMonthlyScoresAsOf: 9708 fromFile: "score.9708" ;
   Security loadMonthlyScoresAsOf: 9709 fromFile: "score.9709" ;
</b></pre>
or equivalently:<pre><b>
   !start <- 8801 asDate;
   !end <- 9709 asDate;
   !date <- start;

   [ date <= end ]
   whileTrue:
     [ !file <- "score." concat: (date asInteger drop: 2 . take: 4);
       Security loadMonthlyScoresAsOf: date fromFile: file ;
      :date <- date + 1 monthEnds;
     ];
</b></pre>
Depending on the available memory resources at the time of execution, the serial load
of the files might not complete and will use up a large amount of swap if executed in a
single Vision query as shown above.
<p>
To optimize swap usage, force query execution at regular intervals either by adding <i>?g</i>
or by pressing the <b>F2</b> key.  Although both load styles above are serial, using the
<i>whileTrue:</i> block forces all serial loads to be processed in a single query; consequently,
this technique should not be used for processing multiple file loads.
<p>
The most optimized multiple file load forces query execution after each file is processed; there
is no overhead in processing time: <b><pre>
   Security loadMonthlyScoresAsOf: 8712 fromFile: "score.8712" ;
   ?g
   Security loadMonthlyScoresAsOf: 8801 fromFile: "score.8801" ;
   ?g
    .
    .
   Security loadMonthlyScoresAsOf: 9708 fromFile: "score.9708" ;
   ?g
   Security loadMonthlyScoresAsOf: 9709 fromFile: "score.9709" ;
   ?g
</b></pre>
<p>
A further optimization would be to reverse the load order, i.e. start with the largest file
(dated 9707). However, the amount of additional savings in swap is not of the same order
of magnitude; therefore, this step can be omitted if data loads cannot be processed in
any random order.
