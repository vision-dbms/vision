<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>
Special structures have been designed to manage dividend,
price, and adjustment data in the Vision database.
These structures have been created to correctly handle split and
currency adjustments
automatically.  In addition, these structures have been designed
to facilitate future reorganizations as the database grows, so that 
applications that use this data are sheltered from structural changes.
<p>
Many items defined for a security are affected by stock splits
including price, shares outstanding, and dividends per share.
By default, data is returned split adjusted relative to the current
date.
In general, message names that begin with the character '_' indicate
the "raw", unadjusted data value in its initial units.  For example,
the property <i>_sharesOut</i> defined at <i>Security</i> refers to the
actual shares outstanding value as of a specific date.  The message
<i>sharesOut</i> returns this value adjusted for any splits that have
occurred since that date.
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="divs">Dividends</h3>
<p>
The message <i>dividend</i> returns the split-adjusted, currency-adjusted
dividend value for a specific security.  The dividend value is
accessed as of the current date by default.  The data is adjusted
through the current date in the base currency of the security by
default.  For example:  <pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM dividend
</b></tt></pre>
returns GM's latest dividend value in US dollars,<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM :dividend asOf: 9502 .
</b>or<b>
     9502 evaluate: [ Named Security GM dividend ] 
</b></tt></pre>
returns GM's latest dividend value as of Feb 1995 in US dollars, 
and<pre><tt><b>
     "CAN" asCurrency evaluate: [ Named Security GM dividend ] 
</b></tt></pre>
returns GM's latest dividend value in Canadian dollars.  All values
are split-adjusted through the current date.  
The message <i>getDivsFrom:to:</i>
returns the total dividends paid by the security between the two
dates supplied.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM getDivsFrom: 950201 to: 950331
</b></tt></pre>
returns the total dividends paid between the two dates.
The message <i>totalReturnFrom:to:</i> returns the total
return between the two dates supplied.  For example, 
to access the total return for the same period use:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM totalReturnFrom: 950201 to: 950331
</b></tt></pre>
The actual time series of dividend values is stored in the time
series property <i>dividendSeries</i>.  The values in this time series
are instances of the class <i>DivRecord</i>, which has been created to
store the information needed to fully describe a dividend.  In
addition to the dividend value, instances of this class maintain the
currency and date of the dividend so that proper split and currency
adjustments can happen.  
<p>
The following key messages are defined for the class <i>DivRecord</i>:

<p>
To support the possibility of future reorganization of this data
structure for performance and storage reasons, the method <i>dividends</i>
has been defined to return this time series.  Unless you are
explicitly writing methods that update the time series, you should
use the <i>dividends</i> message to access your data.  In this way, your
code will be immune to any changes that may be made to the
underlying data structure that manages the actual time series.
<p>
For example, to display the adjusted and unadjusted dividend values
for each of GM's dividends, you could use:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM dividends
     do: [ ^date print: 12 ;       #-- date in time series
           date print: 12 ;        #-- date in record - should match
           div print ;             #-- adjusted value
           _div print ;            #-- unadjusted value
           currencyFactor print ;  #-- should be 1
           newLine print ;
         ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
Note that the <i>dividends</i> message returns an actual time series
object so you need not prepend the ":"  to the message name.  
<p>
Dividends are normally updated as part of the daily cycle.  Permanent
corrections to any incorrect dividends are also made using a
database administration procedure.  If you need to temporarily fix 
a dividend for your working session, you can use one of the
following messages:
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>setDivTo: divValue asOf: date inCurrency: currency</i>
<li><i>changeDivOn: date to: divValue</i>
<li><i>changeDivCurrencyOn: date to: currency</i>
</ul>
where <i>divValue</i> is a number, the date is a date (or integer
equivalent), and the currency is a currency object or a string
containing a valid currency code.    For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM setDivTo: 1.23 asOf: 950513 inCurrency: "US" ;
</b></tt></pre>
adds a new <i>GM</i> dividend of <i>1.23</i> on <i>May 13</i> in 
<i>US Dollars</i>.
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="prices">Prices</h3>
<p>
The message <i>price</i> returns the split-adjusted, currency-adjusted
price for a specific security.  The price is
accessed as of the current date by default.  The value is split adjusted
through the current date and is in the base currency of the security by
default.  For example:  <pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM price
</b></tt></pre>
returns GM's latest price value in GM's base currency,<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM :price asOf: 9502 .
</b>or<b>
     9502 evaluate: [ Named Security GM price ] 
</b></tt></pre>
returns the latest price as of Feb 1995 in the base currency , and<pre><tt><b>
    "CAN" asCurrency evaluate: [ Named Security GM  price ]
</b></tt></pre>
returns the latest price in Canadian dollars.  All values
are split-adjusted through the current date.  The message <i>_price</i>
returns the unadjusted price as of the current evaluation date.
<p>
The messages <i>high</i>, <i>low</i>, and <i>open</i> return the 
split and currency
adjusted high, low, and open values for a security and the messages
<i>_high</i>, <i>_low</i>, and <i>_open</i> return the unadjusted values.
The message <i>volume</i> returns the split-adjusted
volume for a specific security.  The message <i>_volume</i> 
returns the unadjusted volume as of the current evaluation date.
The message <i>priceChangeFrom:to:</i> returns the price percentage change
value between two dates.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM priceChangeFrom: 950201 to: 950331
</b></tt></pre>
returns the percentage change in price between these two dates.
<p>
The actual time series of prices and volumes is stored in the time
series property <i>pricingSeries</i>.  The values in this time series
are instances of the class <i>PriceRecord</i>, which has been created to
store the information needed to fully describe the prices and 
volume for a date.  In
addition to the price and volume values, instances of this class maintain the
currency and date of the price so that proper split and currency
adjustments can happen.

The following key messages are defined for the 
class <i>PriceRecord</i>:

To support the possibility of future reorganization of this data
structure for performance and storage reasons, the method <i>prices</i>
has been defined to return this time series.  Unless you are
explicitly writing methods that update the time series, you should
use the <i>prices</i> message to access your data.  In this way, your
code will be immune to any changes that may be made to the
underlying data structure that manages the actual time series.
<p>
For example, to display the adjusted and unadjusted prices
and volumes for all points in GM's time series, you could use:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM prices
     do: [ ^date print: 12 ;       #-- date in time series
           recordDate print: 12 ;  #-- date in record - should match
           price print ;           #-- adjusted value
           _price print ;          #-- unadjusted value
           volume print ;          #-- adjusted value
           _volume print ;         #-- unadjusted value
           currencyFactor print ;  #-- should be 1
           newLine print ;
         ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
Note that the <i>prices</i> message returns an actual time series
object so you need not prepend the ":"  to the message name.  
To access a full price record as of a specific date, use the message
<i>getPriceRecord</i>.  For example, the expressions:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM :getPriceRecord asOf: 9511 .
       do: [ price print ; _price print ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
and<pre><tt><b>
     9511 evaluate: 
       [ Named Security GM getPriceRecord
             do: [ price print ; _price print ] ;
       ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
both return the full price record as of Nov 30, 1995 from which you
can access the adjusted and unadjusted prices.
<p>
Prices and volumes are normally updated as part of the daily cycle.  Permanent
corrections to any incorrect data are also made using a
database administration procedure.  If you need to temporarily fix 
a value for your working session, you can use one of the
following messages:
<p>
<ul>
<li><i>addPrice: value asOf: date inCurrency: currency</i>
<li><i>changePriceOn: date to: value</i>
<li><i>changePriceCurrencyOn: date to: currency</i>
<li><i>setHighTo: value asOf: date</i>
<li><i>setLowTo: value asOf: date</i>
<li><i>setOpenTo: value asOf: date</i>
<li><i>setVolumeTo: value asOf: date</i>
</ul>
where value is a number, the date is a date (or integer
equivalent), and the currency is a currency object or a string
containing a valid currency code.  The first message is used to add
a new price date to the time series; the next two messages are
used to change the price or currency value for an existing
price record; the remaining messages are used to create or update
high, low, open, and volume values.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM addPrice: 34.56 asOf: 950513 inCurrency: "US" ;
</b></tt></pre>
will add a new <i>GM</i> price of <i>34.56</i> on 
<i>May 13</i> in <i>US Dollars</i>.

<h3 id="splits">Split Adjustments</h3>
<p>
All per share and shares outstanding data in Vision is implicitly
adjusted through some date.  To analyze per share data as of any date
other than this implicit date, it is necessary to account for any
splits that have occurred between this date and the analysis date.
Two viable approaches are available.  One alternative is to actually
change the values of existing data to reflect any splits that have
occurred.  Alternatively, stored data can always remain in its <b>raw</b>,
unadjusted form and an <b>adjustment factor</b> reflecting any splits that
have occurred can be applied to this data.  The advantage of this
approach is that data values are never changed directly, greatly
simplifying the magnitude of work that needs to be done when a split
does occur.  In addition, if a split is incorrectly introduced, it is
much easier and more reliable to just modify a single adjustment
factor than it is to unadjust and re-adjust all of the data that was
incorrectly adjusted.  Because of the data integrity problems that
can arise with the former approach, the Vision database uses the
adjustment factor approach in its handling of splits.  
<p>
To adjust per share data it is necessary to know what splits have
occurred between the date the data is known to be adjusted through
(adjustment date) and the current date.  To accomplish this, Vision
tracks splits for each security in a time series called
<i>rawSplitFactor</i>.  The actual factors are stored in this time series
as of their ex-date.  For example, if a 2-for-1 split in GM
Corporation occurred on January 15, 1995, the value 2 would be stored
in GM's <i>rawSplitFactor</i> as of this date.  If GM's earnings per share
on December 31, 1994 is 10 then the adjusted value of <i>eps</i> on or after
January 15 is 5 (i.e., 10 / 2 ).  If a 3-for-1 split occurred on
March 15, then the value 3 would be stored in GM's <i>rawSplitFactor</i> as
of this date and GM's adjusted value of <i>eps</i> on or after March 15
would be 1.67 ( i.e., 10 / 2 / 3 ).  
<p>
Vision tracks a second time series called <i>adjustmentFactor</i> that
represents the running product of these raw factors.  This variable has
an initial value of 1.  Each time a split occurs, a new point
representing the product of the new raw factor and the last
adjustment factor is stored in the adjustment factor as of the
ex-date.  The data from the previous example is illustrated below:<pre><tt><b>
                          0       1/15/95     3/15/95
<hr width="40%" align=center>
     rawSplitFactor                  2          3
     adjustmentFactor     1          2          6
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
To properly use the adjustment factor data, you actually need to
access values as of the two dates involved, the adjustment
date and the current date.  The ratio of these factors gives you
the correct adjustment.  Therefore the correct way to adjust per share
data that has been adjusted through January 31 for analysis on May
31 is:<pre><tt><b>
     adjustment factor ratio =   adjustment factor on May 31
                              --------------------------------
                              adjustment factor on January 31

    adjusted value =         unadjusted value / adjustment factor ratio
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
The message <i>adjustmentRelativeTo: </i> is used to access the 
current adjustment
factor relative to the date that your data item is known to be
adjusted through.  If you know that GM's <i>eps</i> is adjusted through
January 31, then the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM adjustmentRelativeTo: 9501
</b></tt></pre>
accesses the value needed to adjust the <i>eps</i> value relative to the
current analysis date.  To adjust the <i>eps</i>, divide the unadjusted
value by this adjustment value:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM send: [ _eps  / # unadjusted
                                (^self adjustmentRelativeTo: 9501)
                             ] 
</b></tt></pre>
The previous example assumes that you know the exact date the data
has been adjusted through.  You may not always know this explicitly;
however, many data items are adjusted as of the date they become
effective (i.e., the "as of" date).
In this case, the following methodology can be used to access
the adjusted value:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM getAdjustedDataFor: Named Security GM :_eps
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
In general, methods have been created that automatically return
adjusted values by default.  For example, the pricing and dividend
data described earlier in this section is adjusted by default.  The
message <i>_price</i> is defined to return a <i>PriceRecord's</i> unadjusted
price (i.e., the original value) and the message <i>price</i> is defined
to return a <i>PriceRecord's</i> adjusted price.  The message <i>sharesOut</i>
is defined at <i>Security</i> to return the split-adjusted value of the
<i>_sharesOut</i> property.
<p>
Different data sources have different rules for determining the
adjustment date of the data. 
To address the varying requirements, the message <i>adjustmentFactor</i>
is normally defined as needed for each class that manages data that
can be adjusted.
<p>
The message
<i>addSplitFactorOf: onExDate:</i> is used to add a new  split factor
for a security.  This message
stores the value of the factor into <i>rawSplitFactor</i> as of the ex-date
provided.  The new value of <i>adjustmentFactor</i> is then computed and
stored on this date as well.
For example, if GM has a 2-for-1 split on April 15, 1995 the
procedure to add this factor is:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security GM addSplitFactorOf: 2 onExDate: 950415 asDate
</b></tt></pre>
Raw split information is normally updated during the nightly
production cycle.  It should never be necessary to use this message
directly; however, it can be used to update splits that have not
been included in the daily updates or to correct problems during your
session.  If you insert new dates into the time series, you should
also execute the message <i>rebuildAdjustmentFactor</i> to recompute all
the adjustment factors for the security.
