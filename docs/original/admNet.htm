<a name = "overview"><h3>Overview</h3></a>

Most database management systems only store the raw data 
associated with manual inputs and various data feeds.  
Your Vision database network includes this raw data as well 
as all the structures, rules, and applications that integrate 
and utilize this data.  The various components are managed as 
a single network of information, so that the integration and 
management issues are hidden from most users. 
<p>

Your <i>Vision Network</i> contains all the objects, data,  
and navigation rules needed to integrate, access, manipulate, 
and update shared and private information.  The network consists 
of a set of interconnected <i>Object Spaces</i> that correspond 
to directories for storing the data, structures, and protocol 
associated with a particular database or user.  Each object space 
consists of a set of <i>Segments</i> that correspond to the actual 
files that contain information.  The object spaces and segments are 
all related and managed through a single network controller file known 
as the <i>NDF (Network Directory File)</i>.
<p>

The default NDF is the file <i>/localvision/network/NDF</i>.  The object 
spaces associated with the default network are stored under the directory
<i>/localvision/network/</i>.  Object spaces are directories numbered 
consecutively from 1.  Each of these directories consists of a set of files 
that represent the segments in the object space.  The <i>Vision Network</i> 
directory and file structure is illustrated below:

<ul>
<img src="admNet1.gif" alt="Vision Network Directory and File Structure Image">
</ul>

The segments for a particular object space can be physically distributed 
across multiple disks.  In workstation versions of the software, the Vision 
network can physically be distributed across multiple workstation 
nodes as well.  Symbolic links are placed in the Vision network 
directory to point to the actual location of specific object spaces.
<p>

Although object spaces and segments correspond to directories 
and files, most users should never need to know about this 
organization.  The Database Administrator should understand this  
organization, but will always interact with the Vision network 
using the update and maintenance tools described later in this manual.
<p>

The Database Administrator can modify and create information 
in any of the object spaces.  Private users can modify and create 
information only in their own object space.  The update process  
is described in detail in the section <a href="admUpdat.htm">Updating the Vision Network</a>.
The network update procedures are designed to work incrementally; 
the existing network is left intact and additional segments are 
created that contain the structures that have been changed or added.  
Each time the network is updated, new segments are added to the  
network and the NDF is updated to reflect the new information that 
has been stored. Since the database is never changed in place, aborted 
transactions do not effect the actual database.
<p>

Although segments and the structures they contain are never directly changed,  
updates to the network may produce changes that have the effect 
of making some old structures obsolete.  For example, when a large external 
database is updated, a set of new segments is added to the network.  
The segments that contain the previous version of the database are 
left unchanged.  As a result, some redundant data may exist in the network.   
Two network maintenance procedures, <a href="admTools.htm#compaction"><i>compaction</i></a> 
and <a href="admTools.htm#rollback"><i>rollback</i></a>, are available for 
eliminating extraneous segments and for reverting back to earlier versions of 
the network if necessary.  These and other tools are described in detail in 
the section <a href="admTools.htm"><i>Network Administration Tools</i></a>.
<p>

To protect against possible disk problems or accidental deletion of 
a file, you should periodically back up the network to some form of  
archival storage (e.g., another disk, magnetic tape). The frequency 
of backup depends on the frequency of changes happening in the network.  
Overnight backup should be appropriate and adequate for most  
situations. Since changes to the network can be identified by the time  
stamps of specific files, it is not necessary to back up the entire network 
(which could be several gigabytes) each night.  A typical strategy is to run 
a "full" backup once a week and daily incremental backup during the week.

<a name = "The Network Structure"><h3>The Network Structure</h3></a>

The Vision Network is initially configured to contain three object spaces 
in the directory  <i>/localvision/network: 1, 2 and 3</i>.   
<i>Space 1</i> contains kernel Vision structures and cannot be changed directly.
<i>Space 2</i> is used to store the built-in classes and their 
protocol (e.g., Number, List, TimeSeries).  
<i>Space  3</i> is used to store core application classes and their protocol.  
The information in these spaces is directly accessible to all  
Vision users.
<p>

Additional object spaces are created as needed to organize functional 
components of the Vision network that do not need to be fully visible  
to all users. The information in these spaces is usually accessible  
indirectly, via methods defined in object space 3.  A separate object 
space may be created to store data and processing rules for a specific 
external database.  Object spaces may also be created for users  
requiring a place to permanently store private information.   
New object spaces are assigned the next available number when created.
<p>

For example, the actual data and update structures associated with the 
<i>CompanyDemo</i> database may be stored in object space 8.  In general, 
users do not need to be aware of where objects are stored, since they access 
specific information using messages defined at the class Company.  The message 
<i>DemoData</i> could be defined at Company to link the individual company 
instances that are accessible to all users with the data that is stored in the 
<i>CompanyDemo</i> object space.  The entire process of object space navigation
is invisible to the user.  The expression:
<pre><b>
	Named Company IBM DemoData
</b></pre>

would retrieve the correct object for IBM for any user,  independent  
of the actual object spaces involved.
<p>

When a Vision session is started, a top-level object space can  
be specified explicitly.  If no space is specified, a temporary work space
that is in use for the entire session is created as the top-level space.   
When you start Vision normally, you are accessing a temporary work space.  
To use a specific object space as your top level space, you start Vision with 
the <i>-U#</i> option where # refers to a specific object space.  
For example:
<pre><b>
	batchvision -U8
</b></pre>
or
<pre><b>
	vision -U8
</b></pre>

starts Vision with object space 8 as its top level.

<p>
All Vision sessions automatically have access to the information 
stored in spaces 2 and 3.  When a Vision expression is executed, Vision 
searches the user's top-level space first, followed by <i>object space 3</i>,  
then <i>object space 2</i> to locate any top-level messages that have been sent.  
The message is resolved at the first place it is found.  The message 
search path is illustrated below:
<pre><b>        top level space	         (temporary or private user space)
	      |
              |
	object space 3	         (shared application core)
	      |	 
	      |		
        object space 2	         (shared built-in core)
</b></pre>

For example, the selector <i>Company</i> could be defined as a  
message in <i>object space 3</i> that returns the default instance 
of the class <i>Company</i>.  When the Vision expression: 	
<ul>
<pre><b>
Company
</b></pre>
</ul>

is executed, the default company is returned.  If the Vision expression:
<pre><b>
	!Company <- 10 ;
</b></pre>

is executed, the selector <i>Company</i> is temporarily created  
in the user's top-level space.  When the expression:
<pre><b>
	Company
</b></pre>

is executed at this time, it will return the number 10, since 
Vision finds this first definition in the user's top-level space.  
To access the original, "shared" definition of <i>Company</i>, 
type the expression:
<pre><b>
	super Company
</b></pre>

The default company will be returned.
<p>

To display all the messages defined in the top-level space,  type the expression:
<pre><b>
	displayMessages
</b></pre>

If you started your session with an explicit object space number, 
this request displays all the messages that have been defined for 
that object space, in addition to any new messages that have been  
defined in this session.
<p>

To display all the messages that are defined in <i>object space 3</i>,  
type the expression:
<pre><b>
	super displayMessages
</b></pre>

<blockquote><hr>
<center><b><font size+1>Note:</font></b></center>
This message list will be the same whether you started with 
a temporary or explicit object space, unless you started with 
<i>object space 3</i> as your top level, in which case the <i>super</i> 
message would actually return the top level of <i>object space 2</i>.
<hr></blockquote>

To display all the messages that are defined in <i>object space 2</i>, 
type the expression:
<ul>
<pre><b>
super super displayMessages
</b></pre>
</ul>

The magic word <i>^global</i> is used to access your top level 
from within a Vision program.  For example:

<pre><b>
        object
        do: [ #---  misc messages to object
             ^global displayMessages;
            ] ;
</b></pre>

displays all the messages defined for your top level space, independent  
of the object with which you are working.  The message 
<i>CoreWorkspace</i> will always return the top level of 
<i>object space 3</i> independent of your top level starting point.  
For example:
<pre><b>
	object
	do: [ #---  misc messages to object
	      ^global CoreWorkspace displayMessages;
	    ] ;
</b></pre>

displays all the messages defined for the top level of <i>object space 3</i>.

<a name="Creating New Object Spaces"><h3>Creating New Object Spaces</h3></a>

New object spaces must be created by the <i>dbadmin</i> user code.   
The safest way to create a new object space is to use the <i>installSpace</i> 
script located in the <i>$transArea/scripts</i> directory.
<p>

Three types of object space can be created:  <i>Private User</i> (User), 
<i>External Data Source</i> (DB), and <i>General Database Administration</i> 
(DBA).  A private user space is used to store data and variables for an 
individual Vision user.  The data can have shared access, but it is normally 
maintained by a single, private user.   An external data source space is used 
to store the data and processing rules associated with data files supplied from 
a data source external to your Vision network.  Object spaces created for this 
purpose are described in detail in the manual <i>Vision Database Drivers</i>.    
A  general administration space is used to store any other tools or test procedures 
that benefit from being isolated from the core classes and messages.   
The type of the object space is just used to determine which initialization method 
automatically runs after space creation.
<p>

Type the expression:
<pre><b>
	$transArea/scripts/installSpace
</b></pre>

You will see the prompt:
<pre><b>
 	Setup for Private User [Yes]?
</b></pre>

If you are not setting up a private user space type <i>No</i>, <i>NO</i>, or <i>no</i>.  
In that case, you will see the prompt:
<pre><b>
	Setup for New Data Source [Yes]?
</b></pre>

If you are not setting up an external data source space type <i>No</i>.  
In that case, you will see the prompt:
<pre><b>
	Setup for General Admin [Yes]?
</b></pre>

If you are not setting up a general administration space type <i>No</i>.  
In that case, you will see the message:
<pre><b>
	No Other Choices Available.  Abort [No]?
</b></pre>

If you type <i>Yes</i>, the space installation will abort, 
otherwise you will be prompted for each choice again.
<p>

Depending on the type of space you have requested you will be 
prompted for additional pieces of information:
<pre><b>
	Private Space
	User:	# Unique identifier for the space
	Description:	# Full name of user or other useful description

	External Data Source
	Build File:	# File containing creation instructions
	(see Database Driver manual)

                 General Admin
	Code: 	# Unique identifier for the space
	Description:	# Description of the space's function
</b></pre>

If there are any problems creating the space, the errors will  
be displayed and the session will abort.  Otherwise, you will see 
a confirmation message indicating the number of the object space created.
<p>

Note that if you run this script while the production cycle is  
active it will prevent any conflicts from occurring between the 
new space creation and the current updates.  If you see the message:
<pre><b>
	... Daemon Not Sleeping.  Waiting 15 seconds.
	Remove /localvision/status/tokens/spaceInstall.inProgress if you abort.
</b></pre>

your space creation may conflict with a current update so the process will wait
and try again in 15 seconds.  If your abort the <i>installSpace</i> process while 
it is waiting, you should also remove the file <i>spaceInstall.inProgress</i> as 
indicated.  If you see the message:
<pre><b>
	 >>> Space Install Already In Progress.  Try Later or Remove File
	--> /localvision/status/tokens/spaceInstall.inProgress
</b></pre>
and you know that no one is currently creating a new space,  just remove the 
file indicated and try again.  Note that if you exit the <i>installSpace</i> 
script ungracefully, it will not clean up this token file correctly.
<p>

The new object space is created in <i>/localvision/network</i>.   
By default it should be owned by <i>dbadmin</i> with <i>read/write/execute</i> 
permission for <i>dbadmin</i> and <i>read/execute</i> permission for  
other Vision users.  The new object space directory should contain two segment
files, <i>0</i> and <i>1</i>.  These files should be owned by <i>dbadmin</i> and  
have read-only access for all users.  If this space is to be used by a private 
user, it will be necessary to change the permission on the directory to allow the 
user to update the space.  Note that the user and <i>dbadmin</i> must have permission 
to create new files in the object space.
<p>

To access your new space as the top-level space, start Vision with the 
<i>-U</i> option.  For example, if you just created space 9, use:
<pre><b>
	batchvision -U9
</b></pre>
 or
<pre><b>
	vision -U9
</b></pre>

The message <i>displayInfo</i> is defined for each object space to describe 
the space.  For example, if you are running with <i>object space 9</i> as your top 
level and you defined this to be a private user space for the id <i>xyz</i> 
with a description xyz's <i>stuff</i>, the expression:
<pre><b>
	displayInfo
</b></pre>

generates the output:
<pre><b>
	Object Space Number: 	9
	This Space Contains: xyz's stuff
	Shared Access Via: Environment User xyz
</b></pre>
The messages <i>code</i>, <i>name</i>, <i>number</i>, <i>type</i>, and 
<i>whatAmI</i> are defined for each space.  For example, if you are running 
in space 9,  the expression:
<pre><b>
	"Space: " print ; number print ;
	"  Id: " print ; code print ;
	" Type: " print ; type print ;
</b></pre>

displays the object space number (9), the space id (xyz), and 
the space type (User).
<p>

You can access data stored in another object space independent 
of your top level.  The expressions:
<pre><b>
	Environment User id	#  Environment User at: "id" .</b></pre>
or
<pre><b>        Environment DBA id	#  Environment DBA at: "id"  .</b></pre>
or
<pre><b>        Environment DB id	#  Environment DB at: "id" .</b></pre>

can be used to navigate to the top level of a private user, general 
administration or database space.  The supplied id can be the  
identifier used to create the space or the space number.   
The object returned is the top-level of that space.  As a result, 
any messages defined for that space can be accessed.  
For example, the expression:
<pre><b>
	Environment DBA at: "5" . displayInfo
</b></pre>
displays:

<pre><b>
	Object Space Number:	5
	This Space Contains: Schema Management Tools
	Shared Access Via: Environment DBA Schema
</b></pre>

To display a list of all spaces for a specific type, send  
the <i>displayMessages</i> message to it.  For example, to get a 
list of all DBA type spaces use:
<pre><b>
	Environment DBA displayMessages
</b></pre>

To access a list of all the top level spaces created after  
object space 3, use the expression:
<pre><b>
	Environment MaintenanceTools spaceList
</b></pre>

This returns a list of all the top level environments.  
You can use this list to generate a report describing all 
spaces.  For example:
<pre><b>
	Environment MaintenanceTools spaceList
	do: [ number print: -5 ;	#- object space number
	      whatAmI printNL ;	        #- full access path
	    ] ;
</b></pre>
<hr>

<a name="Distributing Object Spaces"><h3>Distributing Object Spaces</h3></a>

Object spaces can be physically distributed across multiple disks or workstations.  
Operating system symbolic links are used to manage this distribution.  As a result, 
you can relocate an object space to any location that is visible from <i>/localvision/network</i> 
including different operating systems linked by a network as long as the target 
operating system is supported.
<p>

To move the segments in an object space to another location, the 
following procedure should be used.  Note that this procedure should  
only be executed from the <i>dbadmin</i> user code on a system with no 
active Vision sessions.

<ul type=disc>
<li>Create a new directory that will be used to store the network 
segments associated with the object space.

<li>Use a form of copy that will recursively copy the object space from  
its  original location to the target location, preserving timestamps.  
(e.g., cp -rp).

<li>Rename the original object space.

<li>Create a symbolic link to the new location.  This link should contain 
the full path name to the new directory.

<li>Confirm the results.

<li>Remove the old segments.
</ul>

For example, suppose you want to move object space 5 to the directory 
<i>/disk2/localvisionSupp/network/</i>:

<pre><b>
	cd /disk2/localvisionSupp/network
	cp -Rp /localvision/network/5 5
	cd /localvision/network
	mv 5 old5
	ln -s /disk2/localvisionSupp/network/5 5
	#-     execute any tests to confirm availability
	rm -r old5
</b></pre>

The old version of the object space should not be removed until  
you have confirmed that the copy worked correctly.  Minimally, you 
should check the directory sizes and the file names for consistency.  
You may also want to start a Vision session with the <i>-U5</i> option to open 
this object space as your top level.  You can execute the <i>displayInfo</i>  
message to confirm that the space is accessible.
<p>

Instead of naming all relocations explicitly in the object space's 
symbolic link, it is often useful to define these links in a common 
directory so that future disk reorganization can be streamlined.   
By convention, the <i>/localvision/sites</i> directory is used to store 
these indirect links.  For example, the previous relocation could have 
been executed using the following steps:
<pre><b>
	cd /localvision/sites
	ln -s /disk2/localvisionSupp site1
	cd /disk2/localvisionSupp/network
	cp -Rp /localvision/network/5 5
	cd /localvision/network
	mv 5 old5
	ln -s /localvision/sites/site1/network/5 5
	#- execute any tests to confirm availability
	rm -r old5
</b></pre>

The major advantage of this approach is that no <i>/localvision</i> file or 
directory needs to have any knowledge of the hardware's disk structure except 
for the files in the <i>/localvision/sites</i> directory.  If you wanted to 
copy your entire Vision system to another machine that already had  <i>/disk2</i>  
in use for some other purpose, you could store the <i>/disk2/localvisionSupp</i> 
subdirectories on <i>/disk3</i> and change the single symbolic link in 
<i>/localvision/sites/site1</i> to reference this new location.   
No other changes would be needed to make your Vision database operational.  
This convention also gives you a single place to look to find all the disk 
locations housing parts of the Vision system.
<p>

If you use the external database driver tools, be aware that the 
update directory for a driver must be located on the same logical 
disk as its associated object space.  If you get the error message:
<pre><b>
	>>>  Error Default Error Handler Exit  <<<
	*    The Persistent Storage Manager [###]
	*    A System Fault
	* External Segment Link [xyz0.date> ./network/#/#]:"Cross-device link"
</b></pre>

during the database update process, your update and object space directories 
are on different disks and the segments cannot be installed.
<hr>

<a name="Creating Multiple Vision Networks"><h3>Creating Multiple Vision Networks</h3></a>

You will normally have one production version of a Vision database on
a machine.  However, there are times when it is useful to have more
than one database accessible on a single machine.  As mentioned
earlier, all the object spaces and segments in a Vision database
network are related and managed through a single network controller
file known as the NDF (Network Directory File).  When you create a
new Vision network, you are really creating a new set of object
spaces, segments, and an NDF controller.  <p> 

Two starting points are available for creating a new network:
<ul type=square>
<li><a href="#copy">Copy an existing Vision network.</a>
<li><a href="#bootstrap">Bootstrap a new Vision network containing only the core classes and messages.</a>
</ul>

<a name="copy"><h4>Copying an Existing Network</h4></a>
           
To copy an existing network you can create a new directory and copy the <i>/localvision/network</i> tree to it.  
For example:
<pre><b>
	cd /localvision
	cp -rp network newnetwork
</b></pre>

You now have a complete copy of the original network in the
<i>/localvision/newnetwork</i> directory.  However, the NDF
controller in this directory will still refer to the original
network.  You can confirm this using the viewndf tool:  

<pre><b>
	/vision/tools/viewndf /localvision/newnetwork/NDF  |more
</b></pre>

A new NDF needs to be created to match the location of the new object spaces.  
Essentially, the NDF needs to know the full name of its top-level directory.  
To establish this for the new network,  execute the following:

<pre><b>
	setenv VisionAdm 1
	setenv OSDPathName /localvision/newnetwork     # object space location
	setenv NDFPathName $OSDPathName/NDF            # new NDF location
	/vision/bin/batchvision -R fromOSD             # create using OSD
</b></pre>

When the V> prompt appears type QUIT or Ctrl D to exit Vision.  
Your new NDF will be created in the <i>/localvision/newnetwork</i> directory.
<p>
The <i>-R</i> (rebuild) option tells Vision to run in a mode that
rebuilds the NDF controller using the object space directory provided
in the OSDPathName environment variable.  You should make sure that
there are no stray segments left in these diretories prior to running
the rebuild.

<p>

To confirm that the NDF now references the new network use:

<pre><b>
	/vision/tools/viewndf /localvision/newnetwork/NDF  |more
</b></pre>

All Vision sessions that reference this NDF (via the <i>NDFPathName</i> variable or the <i>-n</i> option) 
will access information from the new database.  
If you update the new network, new segments will be created in the <i>newnetwork</i> 
object spaces but will not impact the original network.  
If you update the original network, new segments will be created in the network object spaces but will not impact the new network.  
By default, the user code that created the <i>NDF</i> for the new network will have global update rights.  
If you want to change this, edit the file <i>NDF.GURL</i> in the directory <i>/localvision/newnetwork</i>.
<p>

<a name="bootstrap"><h4>Bootstrapping a New Network</h4></a>

You may want to create a new database network that just contains the core Vision classes and messages.  
The Vision scripts needed to create the bootstrap database are supplied in the directory <i>/localvision/bootstrap</i>.  
To create a new database network in the <i>/localvision/bootnetwork</i> directory, execute the following in Unix:

<pre><b>
	cd /localvision
	mkdir bootnetwork
	setenv VisionAdm 1	                        # update permission
	setenv OSDPathName /localvision/bootnetwork	# object space location
	setenv NDFPathName $OSDPathName/NDF	        # new NDF location

	cd /localvision/bootstrap
	SETUPboot.core /vision/bin/batchvision . >& $OSDPathName/boot.log
</b></pre>

When this job has completed, your new bootstrap network will be created in the directory <i>/localvision/bootnetwork</i> directory.  
To confirm that the NDF now references the bootstrap network use:

<pre><b>
	/vision/tools/viewndf /localvision/bootnetwork/NDF  |more
</b></pre>
<p>
All Vision sessions that reference this NDF (via the
<i>NDFPathName</i> variable or the <i>-n</i> option) will access
information from the new bootstrap database.  If you update this
network, new segments will be created in the <i>bootnetwork</i>
object spaces.  By default, the user code that created the <i>NDF</i>
for the new network will have global update rights.  If you want to
change this, edit the file <i>NDF.GURL</i> in the directory
<i>/localvision/bootnetwork</i>. 
 <p> 

<h4>Rebuilding the NDF</h4> <p>
The NDF contains version information about every update that has ever
been performed since the database network was created.  As a result,
this file can get large over time.  Since the segments associated
with old versions are compacted out of the network on a regular
basis, you may want to periodically rebuild the NDF to eliminate the
obsolete version information.  You must rebuild the NDF if you
relocate the object space directory.  You can optionally rebuild the
NDF to reduce its size.  <p> 

The rebuilder operates in two modes. It can create an NDF
given an object space directory or it can create a
single version NDF given an already existing NDF. The first mode
would be used in the case of a corrupted or relocated NDF.
The second mode would be used to manage the size of the NDF. 
<p>

To invoke the rebuilder, you use the -R option with <i>batchvision</i>.
The value following the -R option refers to the rebuild mode.
Valid values are <i>fromOSD</i> and <i>fromNDF</i>.  
To invoke the Rebuilder in the first mode, use the following command 
line:<pre><tt><b>
	batchvision -R fromOSD -o {OSD Path Name} -n {NDF Path Name}

</b></tt></pre>
The -o option can be omitted if the environment variable,
OSDPathName, has been set. The -n option can be omitted if the
environment variable, NDFPathName, has been set, or if the default
value, /vision/network/NDF is desired.
<p>
This mode will create a new NDF as specified using the object
spaces found in the Object Space Directory (OSD) as specified.
If a file by the same name as <i>NDF Path Name</i> exists, it is first
removed and the replaced by the rebuilt NDF.
<p>
To invoke the Rebuilder in the second mode, use the following
command line:<pre><tt><b>
        batchvision -R fromNDF -n {NDF Path Name}

</b></tt></pre>
The -n option can be omitted if the environment variable,
NDFPathName, has been set, or if the default value,
/vision/network/NDF is desired.
<p>
Invoked this way, the rebuilder simply writes out the latest
version contained in <i>NDF Path Name</i>> to a new file: <i>NDF Path
Name</i>.new . If the file name already exists, it is first removed.
<p>
By specifying the -v option to batchvision, a version other than
the latest version can be chosen. This provides an alternative to
the rollback utility.
<p>
You may want to make a copy of the existing NDF prior to the rebuild so
that you can reinstall it if there is a problem.  For example:  

<pre><b>
	cd /localvision/network
	cp NDF NDF.preRebuild	                # make a backup
	setenv VisionAdm 1
	setenv OSDPathName /localvision/network	# object space location
	setenv NDFPathName $OSDPathName/NDF	# new NDF location
	/vision/bin/batchvision -R fromOSD      # use OSD to rebuild
</b></pre>

When the V> prompt appears type <b>QUIT</b> or <b>Ctrl D</b> to exit Vision.  
The size of the new <i>NDF</i> should be smaller than the <i>NDF.preRebuild</i> file.
<p>

<b>Note:</b> <p> These notes refer to the vision rebuilder associated
with release 5.9.5 or later.  Older versions require that you supply
an arbitraty number to the -R option.  When you rebuild the NDF with
older versions, all segments in all object space directories are
included.  You should remove any stray object spaces and/or segments
that may exist as the result of a <i>rollback</i> operation if you
are using a pre-5.9.5 version or if you are using the <i>fromOSD</i>
mode.  To
confirm the spaces and segments that the current NDF references, use
the <i>viewndf</i> tool prior to executing the rebuild command.
