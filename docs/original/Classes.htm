and instance creation and management.

<h3 id="review">Review</h3>
<p>
<b>Classes</b> provide a basic tool for organizing your information.  Vision
comes with many pre-defined classes including <i>Number</i>, 
<i>TimeSeries</i>,
and <i>Entity</i>.  All <b>Instances</b> of a class respond to the same set of
messages and use the same implementations to do so.  All instances
of a class have the same number and types of properties and use the
same message names to refer to them.
<p>
Any class can be thought of as a table.  The instances of the class
form the rows of the table.  The messages of the class form the
columns in the table.  This tabular organization is similar to the
relational database model.  However, in most relational systems, the
actual data values in the columns are restricted to a fixed set of
simple data types.  No such restriction exists in Vision.  The values
in the table can include instances of any class, including instances
of other user-defined classes, as well as simple values such as
numbers, strings, and dates.  
<p>
Class <b>Specialization</b> provides a means for defining a new class that
inherits common properties and operations from another class.  A
class that is a specialization of another class is called a
<b>Subclass</b>.  A class inherits all the messages of its <b>Superclass</b>.
Each time a new instance of the subclass is created, a corresponding
instance is automatically created in its superclass.  Messages can
be defined or redefined at a subclass.  If a message is redefined by
a subclass, instances of the subclass will use the new message.  
<p>
New classes are always created as a subclass of an existing class.
All classes therefore inherit messages from a sequence of classes.
If a message is not defined by the class itself, this sequence
begins with a class' super class and continues with its super class'
superclass until the class named <i>Object</i> is encountered.  The class
Object has no superclass.  All other classes are direct or indirect
subclasses of the Object class.  The class Object therefore defines
the messages that are available to all objects in the database.
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="default">Default Values</h3>
<p>
Every Vision class has an instance which represents its <b>Default 
Instance</b>.  When a new class is created, an initial instance representing
this default instance is also created.  The message 
<i>defaultInstance</i> is defined as a class constant when a new class
is created 
and returns the default instance associated with the class.  This
instance is often used to store initial values for specific properties
of the class.  Note that Vision does note treat this instance differently
from other instances in its class.  All special behavior for default
instances is defined by methods under your control.
<p>
For <a href="clEntity.htm"><i>Entity</i> </a>
subclasses, the default instance is stored in
the appropriate <a href="clEntity.htm#subclass">naming dictionary</a>
with the name <i>Default</i>.
The default instance for an entity class can be accessed using the
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named xxx Default
</b></tt></pre>
where <i>xxx</i> is the Entity class desired.  In most cases the class
name itself returns the default instance.  For example, the
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Currency Default = Currency
</b></tt></pre>
returns a <i>TRUE</i> value.
<p>
This instance in all ways behaves like other instances
in the class.  To determine if an object is the default instance
in its class, the <i>isDefault</i> and <i>isntDefault</i> messages are defined.
Both return boolean (i.e., <i>TRUE/FALSE</i>) values.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Currency US isDefault         

</b>returns <i>FALSE</i><b>

     Named Currency US isntDefault       

</b>returns <i>TRUE</i><b>

     Named Currency Default isDefault    

</b>returns <i>TRUE</i> and<b>

     Named Currency Default isntDefault  

</b>returns <i>FALSE</i><b>.
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
<a name="sampleNAvsDefault"> </a>
Many messages are defined to return objects from other classes.
For example, the message <i>company</i> at the class 
<i>Security</i> could return
an instance of the <i>Company</i> class.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security IBM company  
</b></tt></pre>
returns the object representing the <i>Company</i> IBM.
If companies respond to the message <i>sales</i>, then the
expressions:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security IBM company sales
</b>and<b>
     Named Company IBM sales
</b></tt></pre>
are identical and both return IBM's sales value.
<p>
<i>Cash</i> is a security that is not affiliated with a particular
company.
The value for the <i>company</i> message for this security could be a
simple <i>NA</i> value.  In the case, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security Cash company sales
</b></tt></pre>
would generate the error: <pre><tt>
     >>> Selector 'sales' Not Found <<<
</tt></pre>
since the expression <i>Named Security Cash company</i> returns the
value <i>NA</i> and <i>NA</i> does not recognize the <i>sales</i> message.
Although you might not ever request the <i>sales</i> value for the
cash security directly, you might indirectly need it in a list.
For example:<pre><tt><b>
     securityList
     do: [ #---  other stuff
           company sales printNL ;
         ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
If the value of <i>company</i> were <i>NA</i> for some securities, the 
<a href="Error.htm#snf">selector not found</a>
message would appear in your output.
<p>
Rather than storing an <i>NA</i> as the value of <i>company</i> for
the cash security, you could store the default instance using:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Security Cash :company <- Named Company Default ;
</b></tt></pre>
Now the expression: <pre><tt><b>
     Named Security Cash company sales
</b></tt></pre>
will return the value <i>NA</i> and you will not see the <i>Selector
Not Found</i> error message.  Default initializations such as this one are
normally done as part of the instance creation process.
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="cd">Class Descriptors</h3>
<p>
The class <a href="tkSchema.htm"><i>Schema ClassDescriptor</i></a>
is used to maintain information about the
classes in your Vision database.  Each instance of
<i>Schema ClassDescriptor</i>
corresponds to a specific class.  Messages defined for this class
enable you to record information pertaining to class hierarchy,
naming conventions, and descriptions.  The <i>classDescriptor</i>
message is defined for each class to return the instance of the
<i>Schema ClassDescriptor</i> class used to store descriptive 
information about the class.
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="subclass">Creating Subclasses</h3>
<p>
You can create a new class from an existing class using the
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     !NewClass <- Object createSubclass ;
</b></tt></pre>
The variable <i>NewClass</i> is defined to be a subclass of the class
<i>Object</i>.  Instances of the class <i>NewClass</i> will respond to all
messages defined at <i>Object</i> as well as any additional messages
defined at <i>NewClass</i>.  By convention, class names such as <i>NewClass</i>
are capitalized, although this is not a requirement.
<p>
When you send the <i>createSubclass</i> message to an existing class, the
following operations are performed:
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A new subclass of the recipient class is created.
<li>An initial instance is created in the new class.  This is the
<b>default instance</b> for the class.
<li>A new instance
is also created in each superclass of the new class.  These instances
are automatically linked via the <i>super</i> message.
<li>The message <i>initializeGlobalSubclassProperties</i> is sent to
the new class.
<li>The message <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i> is sent to the
new (i.e., the default) instance.
<li>A new instance of the class Schema ClassDescriptor is created
and the class constant <i>classDescriptor</i> is defined at the new class 
to point to this new class descriptor instance.
<li>The default instance of the new class is returned.
</ol>
<p>
Notice that new class creation also creates the default instance for the
class.  In the
above expression, the variable <i>NewClass</i> can be interchangeably
thought of as the name of the class or as the default instance in
this class.
<p>
The message <i>initializeGlobalSubclassProperties</i> is used to
set values in the default instance and define class constants and
methods for the class.  It is defined at 
Object to perform the following operations:
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Flag the first instance as the default by setting the value of the
<i>defaultFlag</i> property to <i>TRUE</i>.
<li>Set the value of the <i>code</i> property in the default instance
to the string "Default" .
<li>Define the class constant <i>defaultInstance</i> to return this first
instance.
<li>
Define the method <i>asSelf</i> to return the actual
instance in a class, stripped of any extensions.
</ol>
<p>
The message <i>initializeGlobalSubclassProperties</i> is often redefined by
subclasses that require additional processing steps.  
To redefine the message, the following approach is often 
appropriate:<pre><tt><b>
     NewClass
     defineMethod:
     [ | initializeGlobalSubclassProperties |
       ^super initializeGlobalSubclassProperties ;    # run parent's version 
       # ...  additional initializations go here
     ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
The first line of this method is used to run the super class'
version of the method first, followed by any class-specific rules
you wish to define.
<p>
The message <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i> is used to
initialize all new instances of a class.  Since class creation
actually involves creating a first instance in the class, this
message is executed for this instance.  It is described in detail in
<a href="#instance">the next section</a>.
<p>
Two variations of the <i>createSubclass</i> message have been implemented to
encapsulate frequently used specialization techniques.  The
expressions:<pre><tt><b>
     class createSubclass: string ;
</b>and<b>
     class createSubclass: string at: object ;
</b></tt></pre>
where <i>class</i> is the class to specialize, <i>string</i>
is the name of the class to create and <i>object</i>
is the place to name the class are used to
automatically name the class and define additional standard protocol.  
For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Object createSubclass: "Sample1"
</b></tt></pre>
is defined to automatically perform the following operations:<pre><tt><b>
     !Sample1 <- Object createSubclass ;
     Sample1 define: 'whatAmI' toBe: "Sample1" ;
     Sample1 define: 'isSample1' toBe: TRUE ;
     Object define: 'isSample1' toBe: FALSE ;
</b></tt></pre>
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
    Object createSubclass: "Sample2" at: Sample1
</b></tt></pre>
is defined to automatically perform the following operations:<pre><tt><b>
     Sample1 define: 'Sample2' toBe: Object createSubclass ;
     Sample1 Sample2 define: 'whatAmI' toBe: "Sample2" ;
     Sample1 Sample2 define: 'isSample2' toBe: TRUE ;
     Object define: 'isSample2' toBe: FALSE ;
</b></tt></pre>
Notice that access to the class <i>Sample2</i> is only available via
<i>Sample1</i>.  This technique is useful for restricting the
messages at <i>^global</i> to those that really need to be shared.
<p>
There may be cases where you need to run a version of <i>createSubclass</i>
that skips the initialization steps.  The <i>basicSpecialized</i> message
is available for these situations.  This message is a primitive that
does the minimal work needed to create a new class.  It is used
primarily by methods that need to create temporary classes.
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="instance">Creating Instances</h3>
<p>
You can create a new instance of any class using the
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     !NewInstance <- NewClass new ;
</b></tt></pre>
The variable <i>NewInstance</i> is defined to be an instance in the class
<i>NewClass</i>.  This instance will respond to all messages defined at
<i>NewClass</i> and any of its super classes.
<p>
When you send the <i>new</i> message to an existing class, the
following operations are performed:
<ol type="1">
<li>A new instance is created in the supplied class and all its
super classes.
<li>The message <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i> is executed for this
new instance.
<li>The new instance is returned.
</ol>
<p>
The message <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i> is used to
initialize values associated with the new instance.
It is defined at
Object to perform the following operations:
<ol type="1">
<li>Set the value of the <i>baseObject</i> property in the new 
instance to point to the new instance.
<li>Set the <i>creationDate</i> property in the new instance to the current
date.
</ol>
<p>
This message is often redefined by
subclasses that require additional processing steps.  
To redefine the message, the following approach is often 
appropriate:<pre><tt><b>
     NewClass
     defineMethod:
     [ | initializeGlobalInstanceProperties |
       ^super initializeGlobalInstanceProperties ;    # run parent's version 
       # ...  additional initializations go here
     ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
The first line of this method is used to run the super class'
version of the method first, followed by any class-specific rules
you wish to define.
<p>
There may be cases where you need to run a version of <i>new</i>
that skips the initialization steps.  The message <i>basicNew</i> is a
primitive version available for these situations.
<p>
The <i>new</i> message is normally used to create new instances of standard
built-in classes such as <i>List</i> and <i>TimeSeries</i>.  The message
<i>createInstance</i> has been defined to provide a more comprehensive approach
to instance creation, performing additional initializations based on 
information in its <i>classDescriptor</i>.  The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     NewClass createInstance: keys
</b>
  where keys   is a single parameter or a list of parameters used to
               initialize the instance
</tt></pre>
performs the following operations:
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Creates a new instance of the class using <i>new</i>.
<li>Runs the <i>initializeKeys:</i> message passing the supplied <i>keys</i>
as a parameter.  This message is used to assign the parameters
provided to properties in the new instance.  This message is defined
at Object to assign the parameter passed to the <i>code</i> property.
Many subclasses will want to redefine this method.
<li>Runs the <i>initializeDefaults</i> message.  This message is used to
initialize any properties that have default values.  Any
property that does not have an explicit default value will have the
value <a href="clNA.htm"><i>NA</i></a>.
<li>
Runs the <i>initializeLocalAttributes</i> message.  This message is used
to initialize any additional properties required by the subclass.
This message is defined to take no action at Object.  Many
subclasses will want to redefine this method to address local
initialization issues.
<li>
Runs the <i>initializeNames</i> message which runs the <i>initializeNamesFor:
stringList</i> message for the class.  If the class descriptor has an
associated naming dictionary, the strings in <i>stringList</i> will be
added to this dictionary to reference this new instance.
<li>Returns this new instance.
</ol>
<p>
The <i>createInstance</i> message is defined to call <i>createInstance: NA</i>.
<p>
For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     NewClass createInstance: "NewClass1"
</b></tt></pre>
will automatically perform the following operation:<pre><tt><b>
     NewClass createInstance do: [ :code <- "NewClass1" ] 
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
You could change the instance creation rules by modifying one or
more of the initialization messages as appropriate.  For example,
assume you want to use two properties, <i>cusip</i> and <i>ticker</i> to
initialize new <i>Company</i> instances and that you want to initialize the
property <i>name</i> to the ticker's value:<pre><tt><b>
     Company
        defineFixedProperty: 'cusip' .
        defineFixedProperty: 'ticker' .
        defineFixedProperty: 'name' ;

     Company
     defineMethod:
     [ | initializeKeys: keys |
       :cusip <- keys at: 1 ;          # first element in list
       :ticker <- keys at: 2 ;         # second element in list
       :code <- cusip ;                # for consistency
     ] ;

     Company
     defineMethod:
     [ | initializeLocalAttributes |
       ^super initializeLocalAttributes;   # run version defined at Entity 
       :name <- ticker ;
     ] ;

     Company
     defineMethod:
     [ | initializeNames |
      ^self initializeNamesFor: cusip, ticker ;
     ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Company createInstance: "12345610", "Dummy"
</b></tt></pre>
will create a new <i>Company</i> instance, initialize its 
<i>cusip</i>, <i>ticker</i>,
and <i>name</i> properties, and update the naming dictionary with the
two new names.  The expressions:<pre><tt><b>
     Named Company \12345610
</b>and<b>
     Named Company Dummy
</b></tt></pre>
both return this newly created company instance.
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="delete">Deleting Instances</h3>
<p>
Instances can be flagged for deletion without actually removing the
object from the database.  This is a recommended approach for most
applications, giving you an opportunity to 'undelete' an accidental
deletion if necessary.   Several properties have been defined to aid
in tracking deletion information.  Undeleted objects have values of
<i>NA</i> for all of these properties:<p>
<Center><table WIDTH="400" TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="8">
<tr>
<td><b>Message</b></td>
<td><b>Definition</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>deletionFlag</i></td>
<td>TRUE if flagged for deletion</td>
<tr>
<td><i>deletionDate</i></td>
<td>Date object was flagged for deletion</td>
<tr>
<td><i>deletionReason</i></td>
<td>String explaining deletion reason</td>
</tr>
</table></Center>
<p>
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
    object flagForDeletionWithReason: string
</b>
    where  object        is the object to be flagged for deletion
           string        is the reason for deletion
</tt></pre>
is used to flag an object for deletion.  
It is defined to perform the following operations:
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Set the value of <i>deletionFlag</i> to TRUE.
<li>Set the value of <i>deletionDate</i> to current date.
<li>Set the value of <i>deletionReason</i> to supplied string.
<li>Run the object's implementation of the method <i>cleanupDeletedObject</i>.
</ol>
<p>
The <i>cleanupDeletedObject</i> message executes the following steps:
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Run the object's version of <i>cleanupLocalAttributes</i>. 
By default, this
message does not do anything.  It should be redefined as appropriate
for specific classes.
<li>Run the object's version of <i>cleanupLocalNames</i>.  By default, this
message deletes the object's code from the class' naming dictionary,
if one exists.  This message can be redefined or augmented at specific
classes as needed.
</ol>
<p>
Several messages have been defined to utilize the <i>deletionFlag</i>
property:
<p>
<Center><table WIDTH="400" TABLE BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="8">
<tr>
<td><b>Message</b></td>
<td><b>Definition</b></td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><i>isActive</i></td>
<td>TRUE if object's deletionFlag isNA</td>
<tr>
<td><i>isntActive</i></td>
<td>TRUE if object isActive != TRUE</td>
<tr>
<td><i>isDeleted</i></td>
<td>Same as isntActive</td>
<tr>
<td><i>isntDeleted</i></td>
<td>Same as isActive</td>
</tr>
</table></Center>
<p>
To actually delete objects, you use the <i>delete</i> or <i>rdelete</i>
message.  The <i>delete</i> just deletes the instance without considering the
inheritance hierarchy.  The <i>rdelete</i> version deletes the recipient
object and all instances in its <i>super</i> hierarchy.  There is no reason
not to always use the <i>rdelete</i> version.  Note that these messages
should be used <b>after</b>
the <i>flagForDeletionWithReason:</i> message has been run
to cleanup other information related to the instance.  
<a name="shadow"> </a>Once an instance
has been deleted, any references to the instance from other properties
will return a <b>Shadow</b> instance for the class.  The shadow instance
will respond to all the messages in the class, but will have <i>NA</i>
values for all its properties.
<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="access">Basic Access</h3>
<p>
All objects respond to the message <i>instanceList</i> by returning an
object containing the list of all instances in its class.  The
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     NewClass instanceList 
</b></tt></pre>
returns the list of instances in the class <i>NewClass</i>.  The
<i>instanceList count</i> should equal <i>1</i>
directly after a class is created.  This instance is the default instance.
<p>
The <i>isDefault</i> and <i>isntDefault</i> messages can be used to identify
objects that are (are not) the default instance in a class.
For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
    NewClass instanceList select: [ isntDefault ] 
</b></tt></pre>
would be used to select all the non-default instances of the class
<i>NewClass</i>.
<p>
Recall that the <i>createInstance</i> message creates a new instance in all the
super classes of an object.  In the example:<pre><tt><b>
     Object createSubclass: "Sample1" ;
     Sample1 createSubclass: "Sample1A" ;
     Sample1 createSubclass: "Sample1B" ;
     !s1a1 <- Sample1A createInstance: "Sample1A1" ;
     !s1a2 <- Sample1A createInstance: "Sample1A2" ;
</b></tt></pre>
The class <i>Sample1A</i> would contain 3 instances (the default plus the two
new instances), the class <i>Sample1B</i> would contain 1 instance (the
default), and the class <i>Sample1</i> would contain 5 instances (the
default plus one instance for each instance of its subclasses).
<p>
<a name="hierarchy"> </a>
The variable <i>s1a1</i> returns an instance of the class <i>Sample1A</i>.  It
is sometimes necessary to access the actual <i>instance</i> in the object's
superclass.  The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     s1a1 super
</b></tt></pre>
returns an instance of the class <i>Sample1</i>.  This instance will
respond to all the messages defined at <i>Sample1</i> and its super
classes, but will not know about any messages defined at the class
<i>Sample1A</i>.  You can navigate back to the "true" object using the
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     s1a1 super asBaseObject
</b></tt></pre>
The <i>asBaseObject</i> message will return the actual object that was
created with the <i>createInstance</i> message.  The 
expression:<pre><tt><b>
     s1a1 super asBaseObject = s1a1
</b></tt></pre>
returns the value <i>TRUE</i>.  The <i>asBaseObject</i> message is useful for
assembling all the objects belonging to any of the subclasses of a
class.  For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
    Sample1 instanceList send: [ asBaseObject ] 
</b></tt></pre>
could be used to return the list of all actual objects that are
defined at <i>Sample1</i> or any of its subclasses.  The simple
<i>instanceList</i> message would return a list of 5 objects all of class
<i>Sample1</i>, whereas the above expression would return a list of 5
objects with 3 objects of class <i>Sample1A</i>, 1 object of class
<i>Sample1B</i>, and 1 object of class <i>Sample1</i>.
<p>
The <i>masterList</i>
message has been defined to return the non-default, base object
instances associated with a class.  For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
    Sample1 masterList
</b></tt></pre>
is the same as:<pre><tt><b>
    Sample1 instanceList select: [ isntDefault ] .
       send: [ asBaseObject ] 
</b></tt></pre>
The returned list in both cases would contain 2 instances (<i>s1a1</i>
and <i>s1a2</i>).  The message
<i>activeList</i> is used to return all instances of a class
(as base objects) that are active (not flagged for deletion)
and not default.
<p>
The message <i>asSelf</i>
is similar in function to the <i>asBaseObject</i> message and often
returns the same object.  It is used to strip any extensions
from an object.  For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     s1a2 = (s1a2 extendBy: [ !x ] )
</b></tt></pre>
would return FALSE.  The expressions:<pre><tt><b>
     s1a2 = (s1a2 extendBy: [ !x ] . asSelf )
</b>and<b>
     s1a2 = (s1a2 extendBy: [ !x ] . asBaseObject)
</b></tt></pre>
would both return TRUE.  By convention, the <i>asBaseObject</i> message
is used to navigate from a super class to a subclass and the <i>asSelf</i>
message is used to strip extensions from an object.  
<p>
The message <i>showInheritance</i> can be sent to an object to see the
classes in its hierarchy.  For example, the expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Integer showInheritance
</b></tt></pre>
displays the following:<pre><tt><b>
      ***  Inheritance Map For Class: Integer  ***

      Object
        |
      Ordinal
        |
      Number
        |
     Integer   <===== YOU ARE HERE
</b></tt></pre>
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     Number showInheritance
</b></tt></pre>
displays:<pre><tt><b>
     ***  Inheritance Map For Class: Number  ***
     
     Object
       |
     Ordinal
       |
     Number   <===== YOU ARE HERE
        Double
        Float
        Integer
</b></tt></pre>
<p>
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     classA inheritsFrom: classB
</b></tt></pre>
returns TRUE if <i>classA</i> is a subclass of <i>classB</i>.  
The expression:<pre><tt><b>
     classA isSuperClassOf: classB
</b></tt></pre>
returns TRUE if <i>classA</i> is a super class of <i>classB</i>.  
For example:<pre><tt><b>
     Integer inheritsFrom: Number
</b></tt></pre>
returns TRUE and: <pre><tt><b>
     Integer isSuperClassOf: Number
</b></tt></pre>
returns FALSE.

<h3 id="cluster">Clustering Issues</h3>
<p>
When Vision creates a new instance of a class, it needs to put it somewhere.
Deciding where it goes is an object clustering issue.
<p>
Vision views classes as tables and instances as rows in those tables.
This is more than a conceptual convenience -- it is also the basis for
Vision's object clustering model. Every Vision object is divided into 
<a href="Execution.htm#layers">layers</a>.
Each layer corresponds to a class in the object's superclass hierarchy
and lives in a table associated with that class. As a result, when you
reference an object, you are also referencing the collection of tables
that contain that object.  Each of those tables is known as a <b>Cluster</b>
or <b>Store</b>.
The set of tables used to contain all the layers of an object is known
as a <b>Cluster Chain</b>.
<p>
In Vision, you reference a class indirectly through its instances. The
<i>createSubclass</i> message, for example, always returns the default
instance of the class it creates. 
When you create a new instance of a class, you are actually
asking an existing instance to create another instance for you.
Normally, the new instance will have a row created in each level of the
original instance's cluster chain.
<p>
By default, when you send 
the <i>new</i> message or one of the <i>createInstance</i>
messages to an instance of a non-<i>Collection</i>, non-<i>Built-in</i> class,
you are asking Vision to create a new instance in the same cluster chain as the
existing instance. That happens because all of these messages ultimately
send a <i>clusterNew</i> message to the original instance. 
The <i>clusterNew</i>
message is a primitive message that requests the creation of a new instance
in the same cluster chain as its recipient.
<p>
Not all of the instances of a class need to reside in the same cluster
chain. In many cases it would be inconvenient or inefficient if they did.
For example, when Vision creates objects for its own use, it creates new
clusters to hold them. The <i>Built-in</i> class <i>String</i> and <i>Collection</i>
classes automatically create new clusters to store new strings and collections as
they are created.  References to these new clusters are typically temporary
variables or properties if the clusters are to be permanently stored.
<p>
You too can create new clusters. The <i>newPrototype</i> message creates a new
cluster chain capable of holding instances of the same class as its recipient.
All objects respond to the <i>newPrototype</i> message. The <i>newPrototype</i>
message creates cluster chains that are initially empty; for example:<pre><tt><b>
     !newCluster <- MyClass newPrototype ;
     newCluster instanceList count printNL;
</b></tt></pre>
returns the value <i>0</i>.
<p>
Because there are no instances in these clusters, the <i>newPrototype</i>
message returns a <a href="#shadow"><i>shadow instance</i></a> of the class.
The shadow instance cannot be used to store values. To get an instance you
can use, you must send a message like <i>new</i>, <i>clusterNew</i>, or one of 
the <i>createInstance</i> messages to the shadow instance returned by
<i>newPrototype</i>.
<p>
Classes whose instances are divided across multiple cluster chains are
said to be <b>Horizontally Partitioned</b>. There are reasons to horizontally
partition a class and tradeoffs associated with those reasons.
By default, the instance creation messages inherited from <i>Object</i>
use the <i>clusterNew</i> message to keep most classes highly clustered.
This strategy assumes that you will tend to operate on collections of these
instances. In contrast, the instance creation messages inherited 
from <i>Collection</i>
use the <i>newPrototype new</i> message sequence to horizontally
partition the collection classes. This strategy assumes that unrelated
collections will not be used together and will probably have different
lifetimes.
<p>
The primary reasons to horizontally partition a class are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>to improve instance creation and update performance
<li>to store instances of the same class in different object spaces
<li>to segregate unrelated instances of the same class
<li>to segregate instances with different lifetimes
</ul>

<p>
As the number of instances in
a cluster grows, the cost of creating and updating instances in that cluster
increases. That is because Vision attempts to keep the instances in a cluster
near each other on disk. Keeping those instances near each other improves
the performance of operations like <i>select:</i>, <i>groupedBy:</i>, and
<i>do:</i>. As the size of the cluster grows, however, Vision needs to
do more work to maintain instance proximity. Eventually the cost of maintaining
proximity outweighs its benefits and the class should be horizontally partitioned.
<p>
A cluster resides in just one object space. Since a cluster can only reside in
a single object space, a class must be horizontally partitioned if its instances
are to be stored in multiple object spaces. The most common reason for doing
that is to save your own personal instances of a class whose primary cluster you
cannot save.
<p>
The primary benefit to a high degree of clustering is query performance.
Clustering is of no benefit and not worth the cost for instances that are not
used that way. For example, two lists used to hold totally different types of
elements are unlikely to be used together in a query. Even though they are both
lists, there is no benefit to keeping them in the same cluster.
<p>
Clusters disappear from the database when they are no longer needed. They are
no longer needed as soon as there are no references to any of their objects. If
the same class is used to create instances that have different lifetimes, it
makes sense to horizontally partition the class. Vision uses this strategy when
it creates objects that represent the intermediate results of a program. The
same strategy can be employed in your applications.
<p>
In summary:
<p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <i>new</i> and <i>clusterNew</i> messages are identical
for most classes.  By default, most classes have one cluster 
and new instances are created in this cluster.  
<li>The <i>newPrototype</i> message is used to start a new cluster
for a class.  This cluster initially has 0 instances.  
<li>The <i>Collection</i> subclasses are not clustered by default.  The
<i>new</i> message creates the new instance in a new cluster.  The
<i>clusterNew</i> message creates the new instance in the same cluster
as the recipient collection.
<li><i>Strings</i> are not clustered by default.  As new strings are created,
they are stored in separate clusters.  Modifying a string will return a new
string but it will not be in the same cluster as the original string.
Additional techniques are used to recluster strings if needed.
</ol>
<p>
When you send the <i>newPrototype</i> message to an object, it starts
a new cluster for physically storing instances.
The new structure is at the same level of inheritance as the 
original.  Messages defined at the original class or any subsequent
clusters are seen by all clusters.  
The <i>instanceList</i> message only
returns the list of instances in the same physical cluster as the
recipient.  
<p>
By convention, you should always create a new initial instance in a new cluster
and set its default flag much the same way the initial instance is created when
a new class is defined.  It is also useful to create a class constant that
tracks the different clusters that have been created.  For example:<pre><tt><b>
      #--  Create a list to store the first instance of each cluster
      Currency define: 'storeXRef' toBe: List new ;

      #--  Add the initial cluster as the first entry
      Currency storeXRef , Currency ;

      #--  Define a method to create a new cluster store
      Currency defineMethod:
      [ | createNewStore | 
        #-- create new store and first instance in store
        !store <- ^self newPrototype new
        do: [ 
           :defaultFlag <- TRUE ;
            #- other initializations
            ] ;

        #--  use this if you want to name the store at ^global
        ^global define: whatAmI toBe: store ; 
        #--  add new store to storeXRef list
        ^self storeXRef, store ;
        store
      ] ;

   
     #--  define fullInstanceList to return instances across clusters
     Currency defineMethod:
     [ | fullInstanceList |
       storeXRef collectListElementsFrom: [ ^self instanceList ] 
     ] ;
</b></tt></pre>
