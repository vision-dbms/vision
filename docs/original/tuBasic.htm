To run these examples, you should first start a new session then load the sample database using:
<pre>
     "/localvision/samples/general/sample.load" asFileContents evaluate ; 
</pre>
Any other files referenced can be read from the <i>/localvision/samples/general/</i>
directory.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> The <i>sample.load</i> file runs by default on a <i>Unix</i> environment.  If you are using a <i>Windows NT</i> platform, this location may be prefixed by a drive  and optional path (e.g. <i>d:/visiondb/localvision/samples/general/sample.load</i>).  Check with your Vision Administrator for further details.

<h2 id="WorkingWithNumbersAndStrings"><b>Working with Numbers and Strings</b></h2>

<p>Type the expression:

<ul>
<pre>
3
</pre>
</ul>

Submit the request to Vision. You should see

<ul>
<pre>
3
</pre>
</ul>

displayed as the result.

<p>Now type: 

<ul>
<pre>
1.23
</pre>
</ul>

You will see:

<ul>
<pre>
1.23
</pre>
</ul>

displayed. In fact, if you submit any number - positive, negative, integer,
or decimal - Vision will respond by redisplaying the number you requested
in the Output Window. Vision can accomplish this feat with strings as well.
A string is any combination of characters enclosed in double quotes.

<p>For example, type: 

<ul>
<pre>
"This is a string"
</pre>
</ul>

and submit this request. You will see: 

<ul>
<pre>
This is a string
</pre>
</ul>

displayed. Vision can do more than merely redisplay whatever you submit.
For example, type: 

<ul>
<pre>
22 + 5
</pre>
</ul>

The answer, 27, will be displayed. Try this with strings. For example,
type: 

<ul>
<pre>
"This is a string" + 5
</pre>
</ul>

You should see:

<ul>
<pre>
>>> Selector '+' Not Found <<< 
     NA
</pre>
</ul>

displayed. What does this response mean and why was it only displayed
after you tried to add 5 to a string? When you submit the request <i>22
+ 5</i>, you are asking Vision to perform the addition operation between
two numbers, 22 and 5. Since this is a defined operation, Vision complies
with your request by performing the calculation and displaying the result.
When you ask Vision to add 5 to a string, Vision complains because the
addition operation is not defined for strings. The <a href="Error.htm#snf">Selector
Not Found</a> response identifies the specific operation that Vision could
not perform. In this case, the operation is <i>;</i>

<p>Now try this experiment. Submit the request:

<ul>
<pre>
"This is a string" count
</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>
16
</pre>
</ul>

The count operation is defined to count the number of characters in
a string. The answer indicates that the supplied string contains 16 characters.

<p>Submit:

<ul>
<pre>
3 count
</pre>
</ul>

<p>You should see

<ul>
<pre>
 > Selector 'count' Not Found <<< 
 NA
</pre>
</ul>

If you ask Vision to perform the operation <i>count</i> for a string,
Vision complies by counting the number of characters in the string. When
you ask Vision to perform the <i>count</i> operation on a number, Vision
complains because this operation is not defined for numbers. In this case,
the <a href="Error.htm#snf">Selector Not Found</a> response specifically
identifies that <i>count</i> is the operation that could not be performed.


<p>Now submit: 

<ul>
<pre>
"This is a string" count + 3
</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>
19.00
</pre>
</ul>

Although you cannot add 3 to a string, you can add 3 to the number of
characters in the string. In this case, Vision counts that there are 16
characters in the supplied string, adds 3 to this number, and displays
the result of 19. 

<p>This may be a good time to step back and explore what is really happening
inside Vision. The basic unit of information in Vision is known as an 
<a href="Fund.htm#objects">Object</a>. For example, the number 3, the 
string "This is a string", GM's common stock, and a list of companies 
are all objects in Vision. As you have seen in the above examples, 
different operations are defined for different types of objects. 
Arithmetic operations such as + are meaningful with numbers but not with strings. 
The <i>count</i> operation is meaningful with strings but not with numbers. 

<p>Similar kinds of objects are organized into <a href="Fund.htm#class">Classes</a>.
For example 3, 17, and 1.75 are all part of the class Number and "a",
"This is a string", and "3" are all part of the class String. Objects in a class 
are referred to as <a href="Fund.htm#instance">Instances</a>
of that class. For example, 3 is an instance of the class Number. Objects
in a class all respond to a set of operations defined for that class. In
the Vision language, operations are known as <a href="Fund.htm#message">Messages</a>.
A request for an object to carry out one of its operations is known as
<b>Sending A Message</b>. All the instances in a class respond to the same
set of messages. 

<p>In the example: 

<ul>
<pre>
"This is a string" count + 3 
</pre>
</ul>

the message <i>count</i> is sent to the string "This is a string"
and the number 16 is returned. The message <i>+ 3</i> is then automatically
sent to the number 16, producing the result 19. In the example: 

<ul>
<pre>
3 count
</pre>
</ul>

the message <i>count</i> is sent to the number 3. Since the class Number
has no definition for the message <i>count</i>, the <a href="Error.htm#snf">
Selector 'count' Not Found</a> response is displayed. 

<p>All objects in Vision repond to a set of messages. All objects respond
to the message <a href="mObject.htm#displayMessages">displayMessages</a> by displaying
the list of messages defined for object. For example, type: 

<ul>
<pre>
3 displayMessages
</pre>
</ul>

Your should see the messages that are valid to send to the number 3.
The list of messages is expanded over time. The <i>displayMessages</i> message
will always provide an up-to-date list. 

<hr>

<h2 id="Printing"><b>Printing</b></h2>

<p>All objects in the system have a default way in which they print. For
example, integers are right justified in a 9 character field and print
with no decimal places and decimal numbers are right justified in a 9 character
field and print with 2 decimal places. Strings are left justified when
they are printed. 

<p>When you submit a request, Vision automatically sends the message <a href="Lang.htm#printing">print</a>
to the final result. In other words, when you submit the request: </p>

<ul>
<pre>
3
</pre>
</ul>

Vision actually evaluates the expression: 

<ul>
<pre>
3 print
</pre>
</ul>

and therefore prints the value 3 when it is done. Try submitting the
request: 

<ul>
<pre>
3 print
</pre>
</ul>

You will see the result: 

<ul>
<pre>
3         3
</pre>
</ul>

The 3 is printed twice. The first 3 is the one you explicitly requested;
the second is Vision automatically sending the <i>print</i> message to
the result. Both versions are printed in 9 character positions; 8 blanks
followed by the number. 

<p>You can alter the format of the result. For instance, suppose you wanted
to print the number 1.1 to 3 decimals places. Submit the expression: </p>

<ul>
<pre>
1.1 print: 8.3
</pre>
</ul>

You will see the result: 

<ul>
<pre>
1.100 1.10
</pre>
</ul>

The first value is the result of the <i>print:</i> message. The second
value is again the result of Vision's automatic print feature. To suppress
this second value, place a semi-colon at the end of your input line as
shown below: 

<ul>
<pre>
1.1 print: 8.3 ;
</pre>
</ul>

You will see the result:

<ul>
<pre>
1.100
</pre>
</ul>

The print format of 8.3 indicates that you wanted your result printed
in 8 character positions with 3 decimal places to the right of the decimal.
The total character width of 8 includes the space required for the decimal
point and digits. 

<p>Many other formatting tools are available for <a href="Lang.htm#printing">printing</a>.
A few simple messages are described below.

<p>To print the number 5 million with commas, type the following: 

<ul>
<pre>
5000000 printWithCommas: 12 ;
</pre>
</ul>

You should see:

<ul>
<pre>
5,000,000
</pre>
</ul>

To start a new line after the value is printed use the <i>printNL</i>
or <i>printNL:</i> message. For example, type: 

<ul>
<pre>
3 printNL
</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>
3 
3
</pre>
</ul>

The second 3 is the result of Vision's automatic print message. It appears
on a separate line because the <i>printNL</i> message automatically prints
a carriage return after the first 3. In both cases, the number is printed
with 9 characters. 

<p>To left justify a number, send it the <i>print:</i> message with a negative
value for the parameter. For example, the expression: 

<ul>
<pre>
3 printNL: -9
</pre>
</ul>

displays the output: 

<ul>
<pre>

3########        (where # indicates a blank space) 
########3

</pre>
</ul>

The first 3 is left justified in 9 character positions. The second 3
is the result of Vision's automatic print message which right justifies
the value in 9 character positions. It appears on a separate line because
the <i>printNL:</i> message automatically prints a carriage return after
the first 3. 

<p>By default, all characters in a string are printed. No truncation or
padding occurs. The <i>print:</i> message can be used to control the output
width of a string. The value after the : indicates the number of characters
that should be output. Strings containing fewer characters than the supplied
width are padded with the appropriate number of blanks on the right (i.e.,
they are left-justified) by default. A String containing more characters
than the supplied width will have its rightmost characters truncated. 

<p>For example, the expression:

<ul>
<pre>
"xyz" print: 2 ;
</pre>
</ul>

displays

<ul>
<pre>
xy
</pre>
</ul>

and the expression: 

<ul>
<pre>
"xyz" print: 10 ;
</pre>
</ul>

displays the output: 

<ul>
<pre>
xyz#######       (where # indicates a blank space) 
</pre></b>
</ul>

To right justify a string, send it the <i>print: </i>message with a
negative value for the parameter. For example, the expression: 

<ul>
<pre>
"x" print: -20 ;
</pre>
</ul>

Produces the output:

<ul>
<pre>
      #19 spaces                <b>x
</pre>
</ul>

The message <i>center:</i> can be sent to a string to center it over
a specified number of columns. For example to center a title over the 80
columns type:

<ul>
<pre>
"My Title" center: 80 
</pre>
</ul>

You should see:

<ul>
<pre>
             My Title
</pre>
</ul>

The message <i>centerNL</i>: works in the same way as <i>center:</i>,
but follows the output by a carriage return. 

<p>
<hr>

<h2 id="Parameters"><b>Parameters</b></h2>

<p>The <i>print:</i> message differs from the standard print message in
one important way; it has a parameter. A <a href="Lang.htm#parameter">Parameter</a>
is an extra piece of information needed to carry out the message. In the
case of the <i>print: </i>message, the parameter provides information regarding
the column width and number of decimal places to use when printing the
value. In the example: 

<ul>
<pre>
1.1 print: 8.3 ;
</pre>
</ul>

the parameter <b>8.3</b> indicates that the result should occupy 8 character
positions and that the result should be rounded to 3 decimal places. 

<p>Try omitting this parameter as shown below: 

<ul>
<pre>
3 print:
</pre>
</ul>

You should see the response: 

<ul>
<pre>
>> 'syntax error' near source line 1, character 11 <<< 
3 print: 
**      ^
</pre>
</ul>

Since Vision was expecting a value following the <i>print:</i> message
and none was provided, you are informed that you have made a <a href="Error.htm#syn">syntax
error</a>. Vision tries to identify where the error occurred and provides
an indicator arrow (i.e., the ^ symbol) in the area where the problem was
first identified. In this case, the arrow points to the area directly after
the <i>print:</i> message. 

<p>You have actually already seen another example that uses a parameter.
The message + requires that you provide an additional piece of information,
namely a number that you wish to add to the original number. Try leaving
off this parameter as shown below: 

<ul>
<pre>
3 +
</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>
>> 'syntax error' near source line 1, character 4 <<<
3 + 
** ^ 
</pre>
</ul>

As you can see, the error message is the same as in the prior example.
Although the operations you were trying to perform were different (i.e.,
printing versus adding), in both cases you left out a piece of information
that Vision needed to execute your request. 

<hr>

<h2 id="Programs"><b>Programs</b></h2>

<p>Whether you realize it or not, you have already written your first Vision
program. A <a href="Program.htm">program</a> is merely a set of one
or more Vision requests. All the programs you have seen so far have asked
Vision to perform a single request. There are situations where you would
like to perform a set of operations, one after another. Vision provides
a simple mechanism for accomplishing this. 

<p>For example, submit the following: 

<ul>
<pre>
"The Answer Is: " print ; 
2 + 2 
</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>
The Answer Is: 4.00
</pre>
</ul>

The semi-colon is used to separate expressions within a Vision program.
Each expression is executed in sequence. Vision automatically sends the
<i>print</i> message to the result of the last expression. If you terminate
the last expression with a semi-colon, the automatic printing is suppressed.


<p>A <b>block</b> is a special form of program that represents a deferred
sequence of steps. The general form for a block is illustrated below: 

<ul>
<pre>
[ statement 1 ; 
  statement 2 ; 
   . . . 
] 
</pre>
</ul>

Blocks always return the value of the last statement executed. Blocks
are often used as parameters to other messages. For example, the <i><tt>ifTrue:ifFalse:</tt></i>
message requires two parameters that are blocks that contain the program
to run if a specific condition is (is not) met. For example: 

<ul>
<pre>
myList count > 100 
    ifTrue: [ "This is a big list." print; ] 
   ifFalse: [ "This is a small list." print; ]; 
</pre>
</ul>

If the number of elements in the list <i>myList</i> is greater than
100 the program supplied by the first block is executed. In this case the
string "This is a big list" will be displayed. Otherwise, the
program supplied by the second block is executed. In this case the string
"This is a small list" will be displayed. 

<hr>

<p>
<h2 id="Variables"><b>Variables</b></h2>

<p>It is often useful to save the results of specific tasks for later use.
For example, type in the following program:

<ul>
<pre>
!x <- 2 + 2
</pre>
</ul>

The answer 4 should appear. Now type: 

<ul>
<pre>
x + 1
</pre>
</ul>

You should see the answer 5. 

<p>The results of any Vision expression can be saved into a 
<a href="Lang.htm#variable">Variable</a>. You can create as many 
variables as you need during the course of your session. Any information 
that you save into a variable is available for the remainder of your 
session or until you redefine the variable. 

<p>To create a variable, type <i>!</i> followed by a valid variable name. The
<b><i><-</i></b> message is used to assign a value into this variable.
For example, enter the following program: 

<ul>
<pre>
!x <- 2 ; 
!y <- 3 ; 
!z <- x + y ; 
"The Value Of x is: " print; 
x printNL; 
"The Value Of y is: " print ; 
y printNL ; 
"The Value of x + y (z) is: " print; 
z printNL ; 
</pre>
</ul>

Your should see: 

<ul>
<pre>
The Value Of x is:        2
The Value Of y is:        3 
<br>The Value of x + y (z) is:     5.00 
</pre>
</ul>

Variables can be used to store values other than numbers. For example,
create a variable called <i>answer</i> containing the string: "The
Answer Is:" as illustrated below: 

<ul>
<pre>
!answer <- "The Answer Is: " 
</pre>
</ul>

Now try the following program: 

<ul>
<pre>
answer print; 
2 + 2 
</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>
The Answer Is:     4.00
</pre>
</ul>
