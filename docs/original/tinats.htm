<center><h1>Time Is Not A Time-Series</h1></center>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
Representing time-varying data in a database has long been a problem.
While it has always been possible to build structures tagged with time
fields, the database tools for maintaining and analyzing time-varying
data have left much to be desired.</p>

<p>In the days of relational databases,
there were few choices except to use the database system as a simple data
repository.  Most, if not all, of the analysis and query logic associated
with time-varying data needed to be implemented in application programs.
The deficiency of the relational systems was their inability to
create new data types that could hold time-varying collections of data.
If the operation couldn't be done using select, project, join, and cartesian
product, it couldn't be done in the relational system.</p>

<p>With the advent
of object-oriented technology in general, and object-oriented database
systems in particular, the obvious problem of the relational systems appears
to be solved. Because object-oriented database systems can implement new
data types that are directly usable by the database system, it is now
possible to define new types of collections -- such as time-series -- that
model time-varying collections of data.  Presumably, these new data types
can include the operations needed to maintain, select, and aggregate their
contents based on the needs of the application builder.

<p>Based on this new-found
capability, there is now a perception that the only thing to do is
provide a starter set of classes.  Our ten years of experience in designing
and using Vision<sup>TM</sup> -- our commercial, temporal,
object-oriented database system -- tells us that the problem is larger
than that.</p>

<h2 id="CapturingRelationships">Capturing Relationships -- How
Time Affects A Data Model</h2>

<p>Providing a <i>TimeSeries</i> class -- a type of indexed collection
that understands time as its index -- is a reasonable starting point for
modeling time-varying data in an object-oriented system.  Of its many and
extensible set of properties and operations, the salient features of this
new class are as follows:</p>
<ul type=disk>
<li>It is ordered by its index (i.e., last Friday is before
this Tuesday)</li><p>
<li>It supports order-aware interval queries (i.e., find
the most recent observation recorded in the series on or before November
23, 1992)</li><p>
<li>It is possible to use its instances to hold elements
of any data type -- subject, of course, to the requirements of its type
declaration and the type checking requirements of the database (i.e.,
it should be possible to construct a time-series of <i>Company</i> objects,
not just a time series of numbers).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although many time-series hold observations
recorded at a fixed frequency such as annual, quarterly, or monthly, it
is overly restrictive to require a regular pattern of observations -- stock
split adjustment factors and intra-day trades on a stock exchange, for
example, will never occur at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Armed with a <i>TimeSeries</i> class, properties of new and existing
classes can be declared in terms of its instances.  Applications of <i>TimeSeries</i>
in a number of real financial systems developed with&nbsp;<b>Vision</b>
include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <i>pricingSeries </i>property at <i>Security</i> that returns a <i>TimeSeries</i>
of <i>Price</i> objects</li>
<p>
<li>A <i>holdingsSeries</i> property at <i>Account</i> that returns a <i>TimeSeries</i>
of <i>HoldingsList</i> objects</li>
<p>
<li>An <i>industrySeries</i> property at <i>Company</i> that returns a
<i>TimeSeries</i> of <i>Industry</i> objects</li>
<p>
<li>An <i>estimateSeries</i> property at <i>Security</i> that returns a
<i>TimeSeries</i> of <i>TimeSeries</i> of <i>EarningsEstimate</i> objects</li>

</ul>

<p>Intuitively, there are no surprises here.  Just as other collection types
are used to model structural one-to-many relationships, time-series are
used to model temporal one-to-many relationships.  There is, however, one
significant difference between structural and temporal one-to-many relationships.
In most databases, there are usually more temporal one-to-many relationships
than there are structural one-to-many relationships.</p>

<p>With the exception
of a few truly immutable properties, such as a person's blood type or birth
date, any property has the potential to be time-varying.  In practice, which
properties actually need to be made time-varying is a function of the information
the database needs to capture and how that information will be used.  That
is a fact of life and a source of complexity that must be managed.</p>

<h2 id="EncapsulatingComplexity">Encapsulating Complexity --How Time Affects A Program</h2>

<p>An application can use time-varying data in a database in one of two
general ways.  It can directly examine a time-series to display its content,
query its elements, compute a statistic, or perform some other operation
that can be answered locally by the time-series.  Adding an observation
or generating a price chart are examples.</p>

<p>The other way an application can use a time-series is as part of a navigation
from one object to another.  In that role, the time-series is simply expected
to supply whichever one of its elements is appropriate as of a particular
point in time:</p>
<ul>
<ul>

<p><i>ibm industrySeries asOf: aPointInTime</i></p>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>The navigational use of time-series, although apparently simpler, has
far greater impact than any other use.  Other uses are localized to a specific
part of an application. Navigation, on the other hand, is fundamental to
the operation of an object-oriented database.</p>

<p>Every time-varying property
participates in a time-dependent navigation every time it is accessed on
the way from one part of the database to another.  If the data model specifies
that the <i>industry</i> classification of a <i>Company</i> varies over
time, it is incumbent on the application to supply a point in time when
it wants a company's <i>industry.</i></p>

<p>Although it can be done, it is unreasonable to require that every application
supply an explicit extra parameter every time it traverses a time-varying
property.  Access to time-varying properties needs to be encapsulated in
a way that simplifies the use of those properties from an application.
In the case of this example, it is reasonable to define an <i>industry</i>
method at <i>Company</i> that gets a value for <i>aPointInTime </i>from
somewhere else:</p><ul><ul><p><i>ibm industry</i></p>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>This encapsulation is useful for all the obvious programming reasons.
It happens to be useful from a data modeling point of view as well.  The
designer of the database probably intended to assert that every <i>Company</i>
has an <i>Industry</i> -- it just happens that the <i>industry</i> property
of <i>Company</i> varies over time.</p>

<p>The set of time-varying properties is also subject to change as the
database evolves.  If <i>industry</i> changes from a time-invariant property
to a time-varying property, the ability to write a method to encapsulate
the navigation is not just nice to have -- it is an absolute necessity.
If existing programs are to continue to work, the new type signature for
the class <i>Company</i> has to be substitutable for the old signature.
For example, <i>industry</i> has to continue to return an <i>Industry</i> object;
it can't simply disappear or suddenly return a different kind of object
like a time-series.</p>

<p>All of this may seem to belabor the obvious.  Of course these methods
can and should be written -- any competent programmer can see that all
that is needed is some global location to which a method can refer to answer
the <i>when?</i> question.  The ability to create new properties and methods,
is, after all, part of every object-oriented programming environment. The
problem is not quite that simple.</p>

<h2 id="QueryingTheDataBase">Querying The Data Base -- The
Problem Goes Global</h2>

<p>There is a major problem here, and it comes from the use of global variables
to pass the values of parameters.  The objects used to record and supply
the temporal context used to navigate the database are not properly part
of the database -- they exist only to support its use.  They also should
not be globals.  The use of globals to cache state and pass parameters has
rightfully fallen into disfavor -- especially in environments like a database
system that need to be multi-user and multi-threaded. </p>

<p>To illustrate some of the difficulties, consider answering the question:</p>
<ul>
<p>&quot;In which of the last five years did the earnings per share of more
than half the companies in the database exceed the previous year's industry
average earnings per share?&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p> This is a query based on the overall
state of the database, not the content of some specific time-series.  To
answer this question using just the capabilities of the programming language
without architectural support from the database, an application programmer
must manually iterate through the years of interest, running the query
for each year in turn.  More subtly, the need to answer the previous year
sub-query embedded in this query requires that the temporal context change
during the query.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem is not simply
a matter of application programmer cleverness. This approach has pushed
a substantial amount of responsibility back onto the application programmer.
Even if all of this complexity can be encapsulated to look benign, it is,
in fact, a cumbersome, non-reentrant, highly procedural way of doing things.
In effect, this <i>work-around</i> has removed the problem from the database
system -- where it can be optimized by designers who know how to do
such things -- and hidden it in the bowels of an application's logic. </p>

<h2 id="SolvingTheProblem">Solving The Problem -- Dimensionality
Is Architectural</h2>

<p>That time is special should not come as a surprise.  The world is multi-dimensional
and time is one of those dimensions.  Different points in time select different
states of the world. A database dealing with time-varying data needs to
do the same.</p>

<p>Technically, time is a parameter.  Unlike the properties of a class,
which parameterize instances of that class, time parameterizes the entire
database.  The programming tools suitable for parameterizing a class are
not sufficient to parameterize the entire database.  When an application
supplies a value -- or set of values -- for time, it is selecting a collection
of states from the database, not a set of instances from a class in the
database.</p>

<p>Although the precise interaction of time with the data model
is managed <i>in the small</i> at the level of the data model's structure,
time itself exists <i>in the large</i> -- globally and <i>outside</i> the
context of any particular part of the database. Supporting time in a database
-- or any other system that models the world -- requires architectural
support to parameterize the model as a whole, not just the component
parts of the model.</p>

<p>Time is not the only property that parameterizes whole models. Any property
that depends on the perspective of the user places exactly the same demands
on the system.  For example, in a financial system that deals with multi-currency
data, <i>Currency</i> works the same way. <i>In the small</i>, the data
model specifies the rules for accessing and using monetary values consistently;
<i>in the large</i>, the perspective of the user determines how those rules
get used. Other properties such as <i>Scenario</i> and <i>Version</i> play
similar roles in other applications.</p>
