<h2 id="overview">Classification Overview</h2>
<p>
The <b>Classification</b> class is an abstract class used to organize a
number of subclasses that define instances used for grouping and
summarization purposes.  
Instances of Classification subclasses are normally referenced
by other Entity instances.  For example, the property <i>country</i>
could be define for the class <i>Company</i> to return
an instance of the <i>Country</i> class representing the country
in which the company is based and the
property <i>industry</i> could be defined to return an instance of the
class <i>Industry</i> representing the company's major industry.
<p>
The Classification class is a direct subclass of Entity:
<pre>
  <a href="clObject.htm">Object</a>
     |
  <a href="clEntity.htm">Entity</a>
     |
     <b>Classification</b>
        |
        |-- <a href="#ranges">RangeClassification</a>
</pre>
<p>
The class Classification
is used to unify all the protocol that is common to classifications.
Your installation may define any number of subclasses of Classification.
To determine which subclasses have
been defined, use the expression:
<pre>
  Classification showInheritance
</pre>
<hr>
<p>
<h2 id="basic">Basic Usage</h2>
<p>
The standard messages are used to create new 
<a href="clEntity.htm#subclass">subclasses</a>, 
<a href="clEntity.htm#instance">instances</a>, and
<a href="Messages.htm">messages</a>
for the Classification subclasses.  
For example, to define a new subclass and some instances representing
countries and a property that links specific currencies to specific
countries, use the following:
<pre>
  #--  Define the new class and some instances
  Classification createSubclass: "Country" ;
  Country createInstance: "US" . 
     setNameTo: "Unites States" ;
  Country createInstance: "CA" .
     setNameTo: "Canada" ;

  #--  Define a message at Currency that returns country
  Currency defineFixedProperty: 'country' ;
  Named Currency USD :country <- Named Country US ;
  Named Currency CAD :country <- Named Country CA ;
</pre>
<p name="parent">
Instances of many classification subclasses are often managed as a
hierarchy.  For example, <i>Industry 123</i> may refer to "Book
Publishing", <i>Industry 120</i> may refer to "General Publishing", 
and <i>Industry 100</i> may refer to "General Media".  It is often useful
to be able to link these instances.
The property <i>parent</i> is defined at Classification and is used
to store a reference
to another instance of the class that represents the <i>parent</i>
instance.  The message <i>setParentTo:</i> allows you to set up these
relationships.  For example:
<pre>
  #--  Create Industry subclass
  Classification createSubclass: "Industry" ;

  #--  Create Industry instances and link to parent industry
  Industry createInstance: "100" . 
      setNameTo: "General Media" ;
  Industry createInstance: "120" . 
      setNameTo: "General Publishing" .
      setParentTo: Named Industry \100 ;
  Industry createInstance: "123" . 
      setNameTo: "Book Publishing" .
      setParentTo: Named Industry \120 ;
</pre>
The expression:
<pre>
  Named Industry \123 parent name
</pre>
accesses the name of industry 123's parent, "General Publishing".
The message <i>displayHierarchy</i> displays 
the industry hierarchy:
<pre>
  Named Industry \123 displayHierarchy
</pre>produces:
<pre>
   123       Book Publishing
      120       General Publishing
         100       General Media
</pre>
<p>
When new instances are created, the <i>parent</i> property is
initialized to return the new instance.  The <i>isParent</i> message
returns <i>TRUE</i> if the recipient is its own parent instance.

<h2 id="ranges">The RangeClassification Class</h2>
<p>
The class <b>RangeClassification</b> has been created to manage classes
whose instances are used to assign values falling into a particular
numeric range.  Instances are not directly created for this class; instead,
you would create subclasses of RangeClassification for each distinct
range being tracked.  Instances of subclasses of RangeClassification
define the properties <i>lowerBound</i> and <i>upperBound</i>.  The message
<i>getClassificationFor: inputValue</i> is used to access the instance
whose range contains the supplied value.  The message <i>rangeName</i>
returns a string formatted as:
<pre>
  (lowerBound, upperBound)
</pre>
For example, you can create a class to track market capitalization ranges
using:
<pre>
  RangeClassification createSubclass: "MCapGroup"
</pre>
New instances are created by supplying the lower and upper boundary
values to the <i>createInstance:</i>  message.  NA values are used to
indicate that a lower or upper bound is undefined:  For example,
you can create the  instances for MCapGroup using:
<pre>
  MCapGroup
    createInstance: NA, 400 .
    setNameTo: "less than $400M" ;
  MCapGroup
    createInstance: 400, 1000 .
    setNameTo: "$400M - $1,000M" ;
  MCapGroup
    createInstance: 1000, 2000 .
    setNameTo: "$1,000M - $2,000M" ;
  MCapGroup
    createInstance: 2000, 5000 .
    setNameTo: "$2,000M - $5,000M" ;
  MCapGroup
    createInstance: 5000, NA .
    setNameTo: "greater than $5,000M" ;
</pre>
The expression:
<pre>
  MCapGroup getClassificationFor: 2300
</pre>
returns the instance represented by the range 2000,5000 .
Selection is done using:
<pre>
  inputValue >= lowerBound && inputValue < upperBound
</pre>
Assume that the property <i>marketCap</i> is defined for the class
<i>Security</i> to return a numeric value.
For reporting purposes you may want to group your securities into 
their market capitalization range and display summary data for each
group.  For example:
<pre>
  Security masterList
  extendBy: 
    [ !mcapGroup <- 
         ^global MCapGroup getClassificationFor: marketCap ;
    ] .
  groupedBy: [ mcapGroup ] .
  do: [ name print: 30 ; 
        groupList count print ;
        groupList min: [ marketCap ] . print ; 
        groupList max: [ marketCap ] . printNL ;
      ] ;
</pre>
