<h2 id="BasicAccess">Basic Access</h2>

<p>There are many objects in Vision that you need to access by name. Because
Vision allows you to maintain many different classes of information, certain
conventions have been established to help keep the names straight. For
example, suppose you manage a portfolio for General Motors, analyze the
company General Motors, and own the common stock of General Motors. These
would represent three distinct objects in Vision. The variable name GM
could only be associated with one of these objects. To address this situation,
a separate <a href="clDict.htm#named">dictionary of names</a> is set up
for each entity class. You would access a specific entity object using
an expression of the form: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM</pre>
</ul>

to access the Company object or 

<ul>
<pre>Named Account GM</pre>
</ul>

to access the Account object. For example, the sample database
includes a sector named RETAIL and an industry named RETAIL. The expression:

<ul>
<pre>Named Industry RETAIL</pre>
</ul>

accesses the industry and the expression: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Sector RETAIL</pre>
</ul>

accesses the sector. 

<p>Type and execute the expression: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM</pre>
</ul>

You should see:

<ul>
<pre>GM</pre>
</ul>

Now try accessing a company that does not exist: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company XYZ</pre>
</ul>

You should see:

<ul>
<pre>>>> Selector 'XYZ' Not Found <<< 
       NA </pre>
</ul>

Because XYZ is not defined as a Company, Vision displays a <a href="Error.htm#snf">not
found</a> error and returns the value <i>NA</i> (not available) as the 
result. 

<p>To access the latest sales value for GM, execute the expression: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM sales</pre>
</ul>

You should see:

<ul>
<pre>101781.00</pre>
</ul>

To access GM's price, execute: 
<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM price</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 
<ul>
<pre>32.12</pre>
</ul>

If you request information that does not exist, you will receive a <a href="Error.htm#snf">Selector
Not Found</a> message as shown below: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM xyz </pre>
</ul>

You should see

<ul>
<pre>>>> Selector 'xyz' Not Found <<< 
      NA </pre>
</ul>

This message informs you that the company GM does not respond to the
message <i>xyz</i>. To determine what messages the company does respond
to, send the <a href="mObject.htm#displayMessages">displayMessages</a> message:

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM displayMessages</pre>
</ul>

You will see a list of the messages that have been defined for the Company
class. Because all instances of a class respond to the same messages, the
expression: 

<ul>
<pre>Company displayMessages</pre>
</ul>

is identical to the previous expression. To access the earnings per
share value for GM, execute: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM earningsPerShare</pre>
</ul>

producing the result: 

<ul>
<pre>5.03</pre>
</ul>

Change <i>GM</i> to <i>IBM</i> as shown below: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company IBM earningsPerShare</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>8.72</pre>
</ul>

To better identify what information is being printed, modify the previous
program as shown below:

<ul>
<pre>"IBM Earnings Per Share: " print; 
Named Company IBM earningsPerShare</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>IBM Earnings Per Share: 8.72</pre>
</ul>

You can do calculations with the information you access. For example,
to compute GM's return on equity, execute the following: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM netIncome / Named Company GM commonEquity * 100</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>10.76</pre>
</ul>

Suppose you want to display several pieces of information for GM in
the same program. For example, to look at the components of return on equity
followed by the computation, execute: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM netIncome print: 10.3 ; 
Named Company GM commonEquity print: 10.3 ; 
Named Company GM netIncome / Named Company GM commonEquity * 100 </pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>3550.900  32988.910  10.76</pre>
</ul>

To make the results of the last program more presentable, try the following
modifications: 

<ul>
<pre>"Net Income" print: 30 ; 
Named Company GM netIncome printNL: 10.3 ; 
"Common Equity" print: 30 ; 
Named Company GM commonEquity printNL: 10.3 ; 
"Return On Equity" print: 30 ; 
Named Company GM netIncome / Named Company GM commonEquity 
* 100 printNL: 10.3 ; </pre>
</ul>

Your should see: 

<ul>
<pre>Net Income              3550.900
Common Equity          32988.910
Return On Equity          10.764</pre>
</ul>

The <i>print: 30</i> message to the strings causes them to be padded
with blank spaces so that the labels are all the same length. The <i>printNL:</i>
message is used to separate each item into its own row.

<h2 id="AccessShortcuts">Access Shortcuts</h2>

<p>By this time, you have probably become tired of typing <i>Named Company
GM</i> over and over again. Several techniques are available in Vision
to help streamline your programs. 

<p>You can create a <a href="Lang.htm#variable">variable</a> that represents
the company GM. To do this type: 

<ul>
<pre>!gm <- Named Company GM</pre>
</ul>

The variable <i>gm</i> will remain available until you terminate your
session. The expression: 

<ul>
<pre>gm sales</pre>
</ul>

can now be used to access GM's latest sales value and the program: 

<ul>
<pre>"Net Income" print: 30 ; 
gm netIncome printNL: 10.3 ; 
"Common Equity" print: 30 ; 
gm commonEquity printNL: 10.3 ; 
"Return On Equity" print: 30 ; 
gm netIncome / gm commonEquity * 100 printNL: 10.3 ;</pre>
</ul>

can be used to compute and display GM's return on equity calculation.
Variables can be used to save the results of calculations. For example,
a variable can be created to store the results of the roe calculation:

<ul>
<pre>!roeGM <- gm netIncome / gm commonEquity * 100 ;</pre>
</ul>

The previous program could then be rewritten as: 

<ul>
<pre>gm netIncome print: 10.3 ; 
gm commonEquity print: 10.3 ; 
roeGM </pre>
</ul>

By creating the variables <i>gm</i> and <i>roeGM</i> you were able to
eliminate some typing in the previous examples. Unfortunately, this approach
is only useful if you are working the company GM. The <i>do:</i> message
provides a more general way to streamline your program. 

<p>Type the following: 

<ul>
<pre>gm 
do: [ name print: 30 ; 
      sales print: 10 ; 
      netIncome print: 10 ; 
    ] ;</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>General Motors Corp          101781.00   3550.90</pre>
</ul>

The <i><a href="clObject.htm#do:">do:</a></i> message can be used to "factor out" 
the repeated expression in the body of your program, in this
case the <i>gm</i>. The <i>do:</i> message requires one parameter. This
parameter is enclosed by square brackets [ ]. All expressions inside the
brackets are evaluated for the company GM. Any valid Vision expression
can be included inside the brackets. The previous example is identical
to: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM 
do: [ name print: 30 ; 
      sales print: 10 ; 
      netIncome print: 10 ; 
    ] ; </pre>
</ul>

In addition to sales, suppose that you wished to calculate the price-earnings
ratio for GM by dividing the price by the earnings per share value. The
program: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM 
do: [ name print: 30 ; 
      sales print: 10 ; 
      price / earningsPerShare print:10 ; 
    ] ; </pre>
</ul>

produces the result: 

<ul>
<pre>General Motors Corp        101781.00   6.39</pre>
</ul>

To find the same information for IBM, change <i>GM</i> to <i>IBM </i>as
shown below: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company IBM 
do: [ name print: 30 ; 
      sales print: 10 ; 
      price / earningsPerShare print:10 ; 
    ] ; </pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>IBM Corp     54217.02    9.26</pre>
</ul>

To find the same information for Exxon, change <i>IBM</i> to <i>XON</i>
as shown below: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company XON 
do: [ name print: 30 ; 
      sales print: 10 ; 
      price / earningsPerShare print:10 ; 
    ] ; </pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>Exxon Corp       76416.00       18.62</pre>
</ul>

<h2 id="DevelopingPrograms">Developing Programs</h2>

<p>You saw in the previous example that the <i>do:</i> message allows you
to develop a program for one company and easily modify it to work with
another one. By combining this streamlined access mechanism with various
formatting techniques, you are ready to build substantial programs. 

<p>Start by labeling the items displayed in the previous report: 

<pre>Named Company GM 
do: [ 
     "Sales" print: 30 ; 
      sales printNL: 10 ; 
     "Price-Earning Ratio" print: 30 ; 
     price / earningsPerShare printNL: 10 ; 
    ] ; </pre>

producing the result: 

<ul>
<pre>Sales                101781.00
Price-Earning Ratio       6.39</pre>
</ul>


<p>To display net income as the second line item in this report, modify
the previous program as follows: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM 
do: [ "Sales" print: 30 ; 
      sales printNL: 10 ; 
      "Net Income" print: 30 ; 
      netIncome printNL: 10 ; 
      "Price-Earning Ratio" print: 30 ; 
      price /earningsPerShare printNL:10 ; 
    ] ; </pre>
</ul>

producing the result: 

<ul>
<pre>Sales               101781.00
Net Income            3550.90
Price-Earning Ratio      6.39</pre>
</ul>

To display the large numbers with commas to make them more readable,
modify the program as shown below: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM 
do: [ "Sales" print: 30 ; 
      sales printWithCommasNL: 10 ; 
      "Net Income" print: 30 ; 
      netIncome printWithCommasNL: 10 ; 
      "Price-Earning Ratio" print: 30 ; 
      price /earningsPerShare printNL:10 ; 
    ] ; </pre>
</ul>

producing the result: 

<ul>
<pre>Sales                 101,781.00
Net Income              3,550.90
Price-Earning Ratio         6.39</pre>
</ul>

Now modify the program to print the company name centered over the forty
columns of the report:

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM 
do: [ name centerNL: 40 . print; 
      "Sales" print: 30 ; 
      sales printWithCommasNL: 10 ; 
      "Net Income" print: 30 ; 
      netIncome printWithCommasNL: 10 ; 
      "Price-Earning Ratio" print: 30 ; 
      price /earningsPerShare printNL: 10 ; 
    ] ;</pre>
</ul>

producing the result:

<ul>
<pre>         General Motors  Corp 
Sales                              101,781.00
Net Income                           3,550.90
Price-Earning Ratio                      6.39</pre>
</ul>

Skip an extra line after the company name. As a finishing touch, place
a note at the bottom of the output, indicating that you have just completed
your first major report: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM 
do: [ name centerNL: 40 . print; 
      newLine print ; 
      "Sales" print: 30 ; 
      sales printWithCommasNL: 10 ; 
      "Net Income" print: 30; 
      netIncome printWithCommasNL: 10 ; 
      "Price-Earning Ratio" print: 30 ; 
      price /earningsPerShare printNL: 10 ; 
    ] ; 
newLine print ; 
"--------------------" printNL ; 
"My First Report" printNL ; </pre>
</ul>

producing the result: 

<ul>
<pre>        General Motors Corp

Sales                                 101,781.00
Net Income                              3,550.90
Price-Earning Ratio                         6.39

-------------------- 
My First Report</pre>
</ul>

To prepare this report for a different company, just change the <i>GM</i>
to the company of your choice.

<h2 id="CreatingAMethod">Creating A Method</h2>

<p>It would now be useful to turn this program into a method that you can
run without recalling the program each time. To create a method called
"firstReport", execute the following: 

<ul>
<pre>Company 
defineMethod: 
[ | firstReport | 
  name centerNL: 40 . print; 
  newLine print; 
  "Sales" print: 30 ; 
  sales printWithCommasNL: 10 ; 
  "Net Income" print: 30 ; 
  netIncome printWithCommasNL: 10 ; 
  "Price-Earning Ratio" print: 30 ; 
  price / earningsPerShare printNL: 10 ; 
  newLine print; 
  "--------------------" printNL ; 
  "My First Report Method" printNL ; 
] ; </pre>
</ul>

To run this method, execute: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company IBM firstReport</pre>
</ul>

You should see: 

<ul>
<pre>    IBM Corp

Sales                      54,217.02
Net Income                  5,258.00
Price-Earning Ratio             9.26

--------------------

<p>
<h2 id="BasicNavigations">Basic Navigations</h2>
 
<p>In the examples so far, you have printed numeric and textual information
defined specifically for each company such as<i> </i><a href="mEntity.htm#name">name</a><i>
</i>and <a href="mEntity.htm">sales</a>. In Vision, there is no restriction
on the type of data you can store for a property. For example, the value
for the company GM's industry was defined using the expression:

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM :industry <- Named Industry AUTO ;</pre>
</ul>

In a traditional database, the value of <i>industry</i> would probably
be stored as a string or number in a company table. This value would then
be used to query an industry table in order to access information about
a company's industry. In Vision, the object representing the company's
industry is stored directly as the value of the industry property. As a
result, the simple expression: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM industry</pre>
</ul>

returns an object of the class <i>Industry</i> that responds all the <i>Industry</i>
messages including name. The expression: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM industry name</pre>
</ul>

accesses the name of GM's industry. The expression: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM industry whatAmI</pre>
</ul>

informs you that the object is of the class <i>Industry</i> and the
expression: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM industry displayMessages</pre>
</ul>

displays the list of messages that are defined for industry objects.
Notice that one of the messages is the <i>sector</i> message. In the sample
database, the value for the AUTO industry's sector was defined using: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Industry AUTO :sector <- Named Sector DUR ;</pre>
</ul>

This expression assigns the object representing the <i>Durable Goods</i>
sector to the <i>AUTO</i> industry's property. Since all sectors respond
to the message <i>name</i>, the expression: 

<ul>
<pre>Named Company GM industry sector name</pre>
</ul>

displays the result: 

<ul>
<pre>Durables</pre>
</ul>
