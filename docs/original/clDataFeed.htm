<H3><A name=overview>DataFeed Overview</A></H3>
<P>The <B>DataFeed</B> class is an abstract class that is used to organize the 
classes that translate data from sources external to Vision into Vision objects. 
An external feed corresponds to a flat, tabular structure. It may be loaded into 
Vision from a file, a spreadsheet, a relational database, or any other source 
capable of presenting records of information. 
<P>Several subclasses of <B>DataFeed</B> have been defined to encapsulate 
different ways to map data from external formats into Vision objects. These 
include:

A separate subclass is defined for each format of external data you 
wish to load into your Vision database. For example, subclasses of the 
<B>MasterFeed</B> class are defined to create and update instances of a specific 
<B>Entity</B>, such as <B>Currency</B> or <B>Security</B>. Subclasses of the 
<B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> class are defined to update a specific relationship 
between an <B>Entity</B> subclass and associated data, such as pricing data for 
a security. 
<P>
<HR>

<P>
<H3><A name=basic>Basic Interactions</A></H3>
<P>Each <B>DataFeed</B> subclass defines one or more data items that you can 
update. Some feeds create new instances of <B>Entity</B>, <B>Bridge</B>, 
<B>DataRecord</B>, and/or <B>LinkRecord</B> subclasses; other feeds only refresh 
properties in existing objects. Some feeds support updates for multiple time 
periods; other feeds only refresh properties as of the current date. 
<P>At its simplest, a feed is a tab or vertical bar delimited string containing 
one or more columns of information for one or more rows. For example, to create 
and update <B>Currency</B> instances, you could use:
<pre>
     CurrencyMaster updateFromString: 
     "entityId | name                 | shortName
      USD      | United States Dollar | US Dollar
      CAD      | Canadian Dollar      | CA Dollar
      GBP      | Great British Pound  | GB Pound
     " ;
</pre>
<P>This example loads data using the <B>CurrencyMaster</B> feed. This feed will 
create <B>Currency</B> instances for any <I>entityId</I> not already defined and 
will update the <I>name</I> and <I>shortName</I> properties for the three 
instances included. 
<P>The message <I>updateFromString:</I> can be sent to any <B>DataFeed</B> 
subclass. The parameter to this message is a <B>String</B> with the following 
structure: 
<P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI>Records are separated by carriage-return/line-feed. 
  <LI>Records that are blank and records that start with a # as the first 
  non-blank character are ignored. 
  <LI>Fields in the record are delimited by tabs or vertical bars (| character). 

  <LI>The first record is a header containing delimited field identifiers which 
  correspond to the properties to update. 
  <LI>The header record can contain any number of identifiers in any order. If 
  an identifier is invalid or blank, the data in this column will be ignored. 
  <LI>The field identifiers <I>Entity</I>, <I>EntityId</I>, and <I>Id</I> can be 
  used interchangeably to identify a column containing an entity identifier. The 
  field identifiers <I>Currency</I> and <I>CurrencyId</I> can be used 
  interchangeably to identify a column containing a currency identifier. Field 
  identifiers are not case sensitive. 
  <LI>Numeric values can be supplied with any number of decimal places. 
  <LI>Dates can be supplied in a number of formats including <I>CCYYMMDD</I> and 
  <I>MM/DD/CCYY</I>. The initial date can be indicated as <I>10101</I> or 
  <I>Default</I>. 
  <LI>Values that are not available should be supplied as blanks or the string 
  NA. </LI></UL>
<P>The <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#globals"><B>GlobalsFeed</B></A> 
can be used to temporarily set or alter the field delimiter, header location, 
and other characteristics of your feed. 
<P>The message <I>getUploadProperties</I> returns the list of properties that 
can be updated via a specific feed. For example:
<pre>
     CurrencyMaster getUploadProperties
     do: [ code printNL ] ;

</pre>
Any of these property identifiers can be included in your header 
record. Properties can be included in the header record in any order. The 
message <I>describeFeed</I> can also be sent to any <B>DataFeed</B> subclass and 
displays a description of the subclass, including these properties. The message 
<I>showInheritance</I> can be sent to the <B>DataFeed</B> class or any of its 
subclasses to display the <B>DataFeed</B> classes defined for your installation. 

<P>The message <I>loadFromFile:</I> can be sent to any <B>DataFeed</B> subclass 
to read the data from the file name supplied as a parameter. The data in the 
file should be in exactly the same format as the <I>updateFromString:</I> 
version. The first line of the file should contain tab or |-delimited field 
identifiers. The remaining lines in the file should contain delimited data 
records. For loading data from large files, you should use the <A 
href="clDataFeedAdv.htm#bulk"><I>bulkLoadFromFile:</I></A> 
options described elsewhere. 
<P>A number of specialized interfaces have been defined that package feeds from 
different sources including <A 
href="pmaDBA.htm">The Vision Administrator 
Module</A>, <A 
href="pmaFeeds.htm#excel">Excel 
spreadsheets</A>, and <A 
href="admBatch.htm#Updating">batch processing 
scripts</A>. 
<P>
<HR>

<P>
<H3><A name=master>The MasterFeed Class</A></H3>
<P>Subclasses of <B>MasterFeed</B> are used to create new instances in an 
<B>Entity</B> subclass and refresh key properties for instances of that class. 
The properties updated by these feeds usually store basic descriptive 
information about the underlying <B>Entity</B>. Time series properties, 
supplemental data, and relationships are usually updated using an <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#eext">Entity 
Extender</A> or a <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#members">Membership</A> 
feed. 
<P>A separate <B>MasterFeed</B> subclass should be created for any <B>Entity</B> 
subclass that you wish to update from an external source. The following items 
can be included in the header for any <B>MasterFeed</B> upload: 
<P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI><I>entityId</I> - id of entity to create or refresh 
  <LI><I>currencyId</I> - id of an existing currency 
  <LI><I>name</I> - descriptive name of entity 
  <LI><I>numericCode</I> - numeric id for entity 
  <LI><I>shortName</I> - short descriptive name 
  <LI><I>sortCode</I> - id used for sorting </LI></UL>
<P>Any combination of these items may be included in any order. The 
<I>entityId</I> must be included. The field identifier <I>id</I> or 
<I>entity</I> can be used interchangeably with <I>entityId</I>. 
<P>For example, if the <B>CountryMaster</B> class has been defined, the 
expression:
<pre>
     CountryMaster updateFromString:
     "id |   name
      US |   United States
      CA |   Canada
     " ;
</pre>
can be used to create country objects and/or update their names. 
<P>This expression will perform the following steps: 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Use the first line (i.e., the header) to determine the data items present 
  in this feed and their order. In this case, the <I>id</I> and <I>name</I> are 
  supplied. 
  <LI>For each line in the supplied string, create an instance in the 
  <B>DataFeed</B> subclass. In this case, two instances are created in the 
  <B>CountryMaster</B> class. 
  <LI>For each instance, look up the supplied <I>id</I> in the feed's underlying 
  entity class, in this case <B>Country</B>. 
  <LI>For each <I>id</I> that does not map to an existing entity, create a new 
  instance in the correct <B>Entity</B> subclass. 
  <LI>For each feed instance, refresh the corresponding properties in the entity 
  instance with the data supplied by this feed. If the property has a default 
  data type, the supplied value is first converted to a value of this type. 
  <LI>Display exception reports. 
  <LI>Run any special wrapup procedures. </LI></OL>
<P>If time series properties are included in a <B>MasterFeed</B>, the value is 
updated on the current "as of" date if it reflects a change from the value 
currently stored. By default, the "as of" date is "today". You can reset the "as 
of" date for the entire feed using the <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#globals"><B>GlobalsFeed</B></A>. 

<P>The <B>MasterFeed</B> subclasses are used to create new instances and refresh 
data for instances of an entity subclass. If you want to use a feed to refresh 
data without creating any instances, you can set the 
<I>disableEntityCreation</I> flag prior to executing the feed. This will prevent 
any new instances from being created but will update any existing instances with 
the information supplied in the feed. For example:
<pre>
     CurrencyMaster disableEntityCreation ;
     CurrencyMaster updateFromString: 
     "entityId | name                 | shortName
      USD      | United States Dollar | US Dollar
      CAD      | Canadian Dollar      | CA Dollar
      XYZ      | Dummy Currency       | Dummy
     " ;
</pre>
This feed will refresh the name and short name for the existing 
currencies but will not create the new currency <I>XYZ</I>. Note that the 
<I>disableEntityCreation</I> only applies to the next execution of this feed. 
Once executed, entity creation is re-enabled. 
<P>The <I>enableInternalIds</I> flag can be set for any <B>MasterFeed</B> 
subclass if you want to automatically generate a permanent, unique id for any 
instances in the underlying entity class. By default, these identifiers are not 
created. When enabled, the <B>XRef</B> dictionary named <I>Internal</I> is 
established for the entity class and the property <I>internalId</I> is created 
to track the permanent identifier. For example, to enable the feed for the 
<B>CurrencyMaster</B> use:
<pre>
     CurrencyMaster enableInternalIds ;
</pre>
Once enabled, internal identifiers will automatically get generated 
every time this feed is executed, unless this option is explicitly disabled 
using the <I>disableInternalIds</I> flag. 

<p>
If duplicate underlying records exist in a feed, neither will be processed and they will be included in the exception report and <a href="pmaFeeds.htm#rejects">reject file</a>. 



<P>If you supply a blank string or the string <I>NA</I> in a feed, the property 
value for the entity for that item will be set to NA or the appropriate default 
value for the item. If the property is time varying and it currently has a 
non-default value, its value will be set to default as of the current date. You 
cannot delete entity instances but they can be flagged as inactive via a 
<B>MasterFeed</B>. These rules are described <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#purges">later in this 
document.</A> 
<P>Two <B>MasterFeed</B> subclasses are included as part of the basic 
installation: <A 
href="pma_CurrencyMaster.htm"><B>CurrencyMaster</B></A> 
and <A 
href="pma_UniverseMaster.htm"><B>UniverseMaster</B></A>. 
These feeds are used to create and refresh <B>Currency</B> and <B>Universe</B> 
instances and define several additional properties specific to these classes. 
<P>You can define new <B>MasterFeed</B> subclasses using the 
<B>MasterFeedSetup</B> class. This feed includes two fields: <I>feedId</I> and 
<I>baseClassId</I>. The <I>feedId</I> represents the name of the class that will 
be used to temporarily store the data from your feed and translate it to the 
appropriate entities. The <I>baseClassId</I> names the entity class to associate 
with this feed. The fields must be supplied in this order. You should include a 
header line in this feed, but the header values are ignored. Both fields must be 
supplied. For example, to define <B>MasterFeed</B> classes to update countries 
and industries, you could use:
<pre>
     MasterFeedSetup updateFromString:
     "feedId         |  baseClassId
      CountryMaster  |  Country
      IndustryMaster |  Industry
     " ;

</pre>
This upload will create <B>CountryMaster</B> and <B>IndustryMaster</B> 
as subclasses of <B>MasterFeed</B> (if they do not already exist) and link them 
to the entity classes <B>Country</B> and <B>Industry</B>. 
<P>Note that if the <B>Country</B> and/or <B>Industry</B> class does not exist, 
the corresponding <B>MasterFeed</B> subclass will <B>not</B> be created. Use the 
<A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#core"><B>ClassSetup</B></A> 
class to create new <B>Entity</B> subclasses. 
<P>
<HR>

<P>
<H3><A name=eext>The EntityExtenderFeed Class</A></H3>
<P>Subclasses of <B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> are used to update properties for an 
<B>Entity</B> that are directly defined at the entity's class or linked to the 
entity via a property returning a subclass of <B>DataRecord</B>. An 
<B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> may also be defined to update properties that are 
directly defined at a <B>Bridge</B> class associated with a specific 
<B>Entity</B> class or linked to the bridge via a property returning a subclass 
of <B>DataRecord</B>. Data may be tracked for a fixed point in time or over 
time. Whereas <B>MasterFeed</B> subclasses are normally used to update basic, 
non-time varying descriptive information about an <B>Entity</B>, 
<B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> subclasses are usually created to update supplemental 
information about the underlying <B>Entity</B>. 
<P>A separate <B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> subclass should be created for any sets 
of data that get updated as a unit. The following items can be included in the 
header for any <B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> upload: 
<P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI><I>entityId</I> - id of entity to update 
  <LI><I>date</I> - date to update (for time series properties) 
  <LI><I>currencyId</I> - id of an existing currency </LI></UL>
<P>All subclasses of <B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> define additional items that can 
be updated. Any or all items defined for a feed can be included in any order. 
The <I>entityId</I> must be included. The field identifier <I>id</I> or 
<I>entity</I> can be used interchangeably with <I>entityId</I>. The <I>date</I> 
should be included with any feed that updates time varying data. The 
<I>currencyId</I> should be included with any feed that includes data items 
representing monetary values. 
<P>The simplest form of <B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> is used to update properties 
defined directly for an <B>Entity</B> subclass. For example, if the time series 
property <I>usExchange</I> is defined for the <B>Currency</B> class to track the 
rate of exchange into US dollars over time, then the <B>ExchangeRateFeed</B> 
class could be used to update this property using:
<pre>
     ExchangeRateFeed updateFromString:
     "id   |   date     |  usExchange
      CAD  |  19970930  |    1.3828	
      CAD  |  19971031  |    1.4090	
      CAD  |  19971128  |    1.4234	
      DEM  |  19971031  |    1.7212	
      DEM  |  19971128  |    1.7638	
     " ;
</pre>
<P>This expression will perform the following steps: 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>Use the first line (i.e., the header) to determine the data items present 
  in this feed and their order. In this case, the <I>id</I>, <I>date</I>, and 
  <I>usExchange</I> are supplied. 
  <LI>For each line in the supplied string, create an instance in the 
  <B>DataFeed</B> subclass. In this case, five instances are created in the 
  <B>ExchangeRateFeed</B> class. 
  <LI>For each instance, look up the supplied <I>id</I> in the feed's underlying 
  entity class, in this case <B>Currency</B>. 
  <LI>For each <I>id</I> that references an existing entity, refresh the 
  corresponding properties in the entity instance with the data supplied by this 
  feed. If the property has a default data type, the supplied value is first 
  converted to a value of this type. In this case, the <I>usExchange</I> 
  property is updated as of the supplied dates. 
  <LI>Display exception reports. 
  <LI>Run any special wrapup procedures. </LI></OL>
<P><B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> subclasses can also be defined to create and 
refresh instances in a <B>DataRecord</B> subclass associated with an 
<B>Entity</B> or <B>Bridge</B> subclass. For example, <B>PriceRecord</B> may be 
defined as a subclass of <B>DataRecord</B> used to track the high, low, and 
closing prices for a security over time. The time series property 
<I>pricingData</I> could be defined for the <B>Security</B> class to store a 
separate <B>PriceRecord</B> instance for each date the security is priced. If 
<B>PricingFeed</B> is defined as an <B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> subclass that 
establishes this relationship, then it could be used to update pricing data 
using:
<pre>
     PricingFeed updateFromString:
     "id   |  date   |  high   |    low   |   close
      GM   |  971215 |  65.125 |  62.75   |   64.00

  date that does not exist in the security's <I>pricingData</I> time series. 
  <LI>For each instance in this feed that references a valid entity/date 
  combination, refresh the corresponding properties in the <B>DataRecord</B>

  <I>low</I>, and <I>close</I> properties are updated in the <B>PriceRecord</B> 
  stored in the security's <I>pricingData</I> time series as of the supplied

  <LI>Expire old data, if appropriate. 
  <LI>Display exception reports.

<P><A name=autoExpire></A>The <I>autoExpire</I> option can be set in the <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#globals"><B>GlobalsFeed</B></A> 
for feeds associated with a <B>DataRecord</B> to automatically add a default 
value to a time series property after the last "real" value, based on a supplied 
expiration period. By default, Vision returns the last available value for a 
time series. This option is used to expire the data if it is older than a 
specified duration. For example, assume your database includes a time series of 
monthly fundamental data records stored in the property <I>funDataM</I> for the 
class <B>Company</B>. If you load your June 30, 1999 data and specify an expiration of <I>1 monthEnds</I>, any company whose last "real" data point is on or before May 31, 1999 will have a default value inserted in the time series on the month-end date following the last real data point. 

<P>If you supply a blank string or the string <I>NA</I> in a feed, the property 
value will be set to NA or the appropriate default value for the item. In 
addition, there are a number of ways to purge information using an 
<B>EntityExtenderFeed</B>. These rules are described <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#purges">later in this 
document.</A> 

<p>The message <i>enableOnlyUpdateOnChange</i> allows you to update time series properties in an Entity Extender Feed only if the value has changed.  This works with Entity Extender Feeds that are used to update fields that are time series properties, not feeds that update time series of records. You can set the switches <i>enableOnlyUpdateOnChange</i> and <i>disableOnlyUpdateOnChange</i> to control the behavior of the next update for the feed.  This value is reset to disable after each update.   

<P>One subclass is included as part of the basic installation: The <A href="pma_ExchangeRateFeed.htm"><B>ExchangeRateFeed</B></A> is used to update the <I>usExchange</I> time series property for <B>Currency</B> instances. The <B>PricingFeed</B> described above was included for illustration purposes and is not part of the basic installation. An actual <B>PriceFeed</B> class is included as part of the <A href="pmaFeeds.htm"><B>Portfolio Management Application Layer</B></A>. 

<P>You can define new <B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> subclasses using the 
<B>EntityExtenderFeedSetup</B> class. This feed includes the fields: 

<P> <UL type=disk>
  <LI><I>feedId</I> - name of feed class 
  <LI><I>baseClassId</I> - name of associated <B>Entity</B>, <B>Bridge</B> or 
  <B>DataRecord</B> class 
  <LI><I>baseEntityId</I> - name of <B>Entity</B> or <B>Bridge</B> class if base 
  class is a <B>DataRecord</B> 
  <LI><I>frequency</I> - offset used to expire old data </LI></UL>
<P>The <I>feedId</I> represents the name of the class that will be used to 
temporarily store the data from your feed and translate it to the correct 
entities or data records. The <I>baseClassId</I> indicates the base class 
associated with this feed. It can refer to an <B>Entity/Bridge</B> or to a 
<B>DataRecord</B> class. The fields associated with this specific feed will 
update properties defined at this class. The <I>baseEntityId</I> indicates the 
<B>Entity</B> or <B>Bridge</B> class associated with the feed for feeds where 
the base class is a <B>DataRecord</B>. This field should be omitted if the base 
class is an <B>Entity/Bridge</B>. 
<P>The fields must be supplied in this order. You can include a header line in 
this feed, but the header values are ignored. The <I>feedId</I> and 
<I>baseClassId</I> must be supplied. The <I>baseEntityId</I> should be supplied 
for feeds that update <B>DataRecord</B> instances. 
<P>For example, to define the <B>ExchangeRateFeed</B> and <B>PricingFeed</B> 
described above, you could use:
<pre>
     EntityExtenderFeedSetup updateFromString:
     "
     feedId            |  baseClassId  |     baseEntityId | frequency
     ExchangeRateFeed  |  Currency     |
     PricingFeed       |  PriceRecord  |     Security | 3 businessDays
     " ;

</pre>
This upload will create <B>ExchangeRateFeed</B> as a subclass of 
<B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> if it does not already exist. This feed will be linked 
directly to the <B>Entity</B> subclass <B>Currency</B>. This feed can be used to 
update any properties defined directly for the <B>Currency</B> class. You can 
use the <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#property"><B>PropertySetup</B></A> 
class to define new <B>Currency</B> properties which can then be updated by 
including these property names in the header record of this feed. 
<P>This update will also create <B>PricingFeed</B> as a subclass of 
<B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> if it does not already exist. This feed will be used 
to create and update properties in the <B>DataRecord</B> subclass 
<B>PriceRecord</B> via instances of the <B>Entity</B> subclass <B>Security</B>. 
Note that if the <B>Security</B> and/or <B>PriceRecord</B> class does not exist, 
the <B>PricingFeed</B> subclass will <B>not</B> be created. Use the <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#schema"><B>ClassSetup</B></A> 
class to create these subclasses and the <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#property"><B>PropertySetup</B></A> 
class to define the property connecting these subclasses. The <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#property"><B>PropertySetup</B></A> 
class should also be used to define the <B>PriceRecord</B> properties which can 
then be updated by this feed. 
<P>The <I>frequency</I> field is optional and is used in conjunction with the <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#autoExpire"><I>autoExpire</I></A> 
option to expire old data for feeds that update <B>DataRecords</B> over time. If 
the frequency is present and the <I>autoExpire</I> option is in effect, the 
check for expiration is based on the criteria: 
<P><I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>last observation + frequency &lt;= current run date 
</BLOCKQUOTE></I>Otherwise, the expiration is based on the criteria: 
<P><I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>last observation + autoExpire value &lt;= current run date 
</BLOCKQUOTE></I>
<P>The <I>frequency</I>, if set, should be supplied as a <B>DateOffset</B> such 
as <I>3 businessDays</I> or <I>18 monthEnds</I>. The frequency can be optionally 
defined in the feed setup as shown or can be set prior to an update using the 
<I>setFrequencyTo:</I> message:
<pre>
     PricingFeed setFrequencyTo: 3 businessDays ;

     GlobalsFeed updateFromString: 
     "option      | setting        | settingType
      asofDate    | 9906           | Date

     " ;

     PricingFeed updateFromString:
     "id | date | high | low | close
      #--   data goes here
     " ;

</pre>
This example will add a default <B>PriceRecord</B> instance to any 
security that was last priced at least 3 business days prior to 6/30/99. The 
default instance will be added to these time series 1 business day after the 
last date priced.

<H3><A name=trans>The TransactionFeed Class</A></H3>
<P>Subclasses of <B>TransactionFeed</B> are used to create and cross reference 
instances of a <B>LinkRecord</B> subclass, classes that associate two or more 
entities. 
<P>Currently, there is no special protocol defined to manage subclasses of the 
<B>TransactionFeed</B> class. You can follow the procedures outlined for <A 
href="clDataFeedAdv.htm#custom">custom

<P>
<H3><A name=members>The MembershipFeed Class</A></H3>
<P>Subclasses of <B>MembershipFeed</B> are used to update and cross reference 
one-to-many relationships between a group and its members over time. For 
example, one or more companies can be members of the same industry. Over time, a 
company can move from one industry to another. In this case, instances of the 
entity class <B>Company</B> represent members and instances of the entity class 
<B>Industry</B> represent groups. To track this relationship, you could define a 
time series property <I>industry</I> at <B>Company</B> that returns an 
<B>Industry</B> object and a time series property <I>companyList</I> at 
<B>Industry</B> that returns a <B>List</B> of <B>Company</B> objects. 
<P>Two forms of relationship can be established: 
<P>
<OL type=1>
  <LI>Track member lists over time for a group - this approach defines a time 
  series property at the group class for tracking lists of member entities. 
  There is no corresponding property at the member class. For example, 
  <I>SP500</I> could represent a <B>Universe</B> of <B>Security</B> instances 
  that is tracked in the time series property <I>list</I> at <B>Universe</B>. 
  <LI>Track a bi-directional relationship between a group and its members - this 
  approach stores the list of entities at the group and also stores a specific 
  instance of the group as the member's value. For example, <I>US</I> could 
  represent a <B>Country</B> that tracks <B>Company</B> instances in the 
  property <I>companyList</I> and <I>country</I> stores the value of a specific 
  <B>Company's</B> country. </LI></OL>
<P>Each <B>MembershipFeed</B> subclass defines the entity class of the group, 
the entity class of the members, the property defined at the group's class that 
returns the list of members defined for the group, and optionally, the property 
defined at the member's class that returns the group defined for a member. In 
addition, a <B>MembershipFeed</B> can be defined as <I>Replace</I> or 
<I>Append</I> indicating whether all members for a group must be supplied in an 
update or if changes only are supplied. 
<P>A separate <B>MembershipFeed</B> subclass should be created for any 
membership relationship that you wish to update from an external source. The 
following items can be included in the header for any <B>MembershipFeed</B> 
upload: 
<P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI><I>memberId</I> - id of member 
  <LI><I>groupId</I> - id of group 
  <LI><I>date</I> - optional date </LI></UL>
<P>These fields can be supplied in any order. The <I>memberId</I> and 
<I>groupId</I> are required; the <I>date</I> is optional. 
<P>For example, if the <B>CompanyToIndustry</B> feed has been defined, the 
expression:
<pre>
     CompanyToIndustry updateFromString:
     "groupId  |   memberId  |   date
      HARDWARE |   IBM       |   Default
      HARDWARE |   HWP       |   Default
      AUTO     |   GM        |   Default
      AUTO     |   F         |   Default
      AUTO     |   C         |   Default
      AUTO     |   XYZ       |   Default

      HARDWARE |   XYZ       |   12/31/97
     " ;
</pre>
can be used to setup the initial relationship between the industries 
and their members and to indicate that company XYZ was reassigned from the AUTO 
industry to the HARDWARE industry on 12/31/97. 
<P>This expression will perform the following steps:

<P>The <I>classId</I> represents the name of the class to create. If it does not 
exist, the class identified by the <I>parentId</I> is used as the parent class 
to subclass. The <I>parentId</I> is usually one of <B>Entity</B>, <B>Bridge</B>, 
<B>DataRecord</B>, or <B>LinkRecord</B>, but it can indicate a subclass of one 
of these, if appropriate. Since the <I>classId</I> is used to name Vision 
classes, the names should conform to the convention of starting with a capital 
letter, although this is not enforced. 
<P>The fields can be supplied in any order. If the <I>classId</I> does not 
reference an existing class, the <I>parentId</I> must be supplied. If the 
<I>classId</I> already exists, no action is taken. The <I>description</I> is 
optional and can be used to supply an initial description for a new class or to 
update the description of an existing class. 
<P>For example, to define the <B>Entity</B> subclasses <B>Security</B> and 
<B>Country</B> and the <B>DataRecord</B> subclass <B>PriceRecord</B>, you could 
use:
<pre>

  <LI><I>propertyXRef</I> - name of property that cross references the values of 
  this property at the class indicated by defaultValue </LI></UL>
<P>The fields can be supplied in any order as long as the header line indicates 
which fields are present. The <I>classId</I> and <I>property</I> fields must be 
present. The <I>tsFlag</I> and <I>adjustments</I> fields are only examined when 
a new property is created so these should be present if applicable. The other 
fields are optional and can be used to update new or existing properties. 
<P>The <I>classId</I> field identifies the class at which to define the 
property. This id must reference an existing class. The <I>property</I> field 
identifies the property to create or update. If the property does not exist it 
is created for the class indicated by <I>classId</I>. The <I>classId</I> and 
<I>property</I> fields must be supplied. The <I>tsFlag</I> field indicates 
whether the property should be created as a time series property. A value of 
<I>Yes</I> or <I>True</I> indicates that the property should be a time series. 
Properties are created as fixed properties by default. Note that if the property 
is already defined for the class, this field is ignored. 
<P>The <I>adjustments</I> field is used to indicate if the property is being 
used to store data that needs special adjustments. If this field is used, the 
underlying property name is created with a _ prepended to it and a cover method 
is defined using the property name without the prefix. The cover method is used 
to access this property with the appropriate adjustments. This field can contain 
one or more of the keywords defined to perform adjustments. The following 
keywords have been defined:

<P>The <I>defaultValue</I> field indicates the default value to set for the 
property when a new instance of its class is created. If this field is omitted, 
the new instances will have the value <I>NA</I> for this property. For time 
series properties, this default value is set as of the 
<I>earliestPossibleDate</I> (i.e., 1/1/0001). This value can be supplied as the 
name of a class (e.g., <I>Currency</I> to indicate that the property should 
return the default <B>Currency</B> object) or a specific value (e.g., <I>0</I>

<P>
<P>If you want to supply a default type but do not want to automatically 
initialize the value of new instances for this property, use the <I>dataType</I> 
field instead. This field will set the <I>returnObjectType</I> for this property 
(which is used to convert inputs to the appropriate class) but will not 
initialize this property for new instances. If the <I>defaultValue</I> is 
supplied, the <I>dataType</I> can be omitted. In general, you will want to set 
the <I>defaultValue</I> when the property references an instance of an 
application class such as an <B>Entity</B>. This will initialize the property 
with the default instance of the appropriate class. If the property is intended 
to return a <B>Double</B>, <B>Integer</B>, <B>String</B>, or <B>Date</B>, you 
would indicate the appropriate class as the <I>dataType</I> and omit the 
<I>defaultValue</I> so that the initial value of the property is NA. Values 
supplied from the feed will be converted to the class specified by the 
<I>defaultValue</I>, if present, or the <I>dataType</I> otherwise. 
<P>The <I>description</I> field supplies a description of the property. It can 
be used to set the initial description for a new property or to update the 
description for an existing property. 
<P>The <I>propertyXRef</I> field is used to establish a one-to-many relationship 
between the supplied class and the class indicated by the <I>defaultValue</I>. 
If present, this field is used to define a property at the <I>defaultValue's</I> 
class that returns an <B>IndexedList</B> of the instances that are members of 
that class. For example: 
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE border=1 cellPadding=4 cellSpacing=2 width="80%">
  <TBODY>
  <TR>
    <TH>Field 
    <TH>Value 
  <TR>
    <TD><I>classId</I> 
    <TD>Company 
  <TR>
    <TD><I>property</I> 
    <TD>country 
  <TR>
    <TD><I>defaultValue</I> 
    <TD>Country 
  <TR>
    <TD><I>propertyXRef</I> 
    <TD>companyList </TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
<P>implies the following: 
<P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI>The property <I>country</I> is defined at the class <B>Company</B>. This 
  property will return <B>Country</B> instances. When a new <B>Company</B> 
  instance is created, the initial value of its <I>country</I> property will be 
  the default <B>Country</B> instance. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>The property <I>companyList</I> is defined at the class <B>Country</B>. 
  This property will return an <B>IndexedList</B> of the <B>Company</B> 
  instances associated with the country. When a new <B>Country</B> instance is 
  created, the initial value of this property will be an empty 
  <B>IndexedList</B>. Note that if the <I>tsFlag</I> indicates time series, this 
  relationship is tracked over time.</LI></UL>
<P>For example:
<pre>
    PropertySetup updateFromString:
     "
     classId   |     property  |   tsFlag  |   defaultValue
     Country   |     x         |   N       |   0
     Country   |     y         |   Y       |   
     Currency  |     z         |   Y       |   Country        
     " ;

</pre>
This update defines two properties <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> for the class 
<B>Country</B> if they do not already exist. Property <I>x</I> is defined to be 
a fixed property and <I>y</I> is time varying. Property <I>x</I> will initially 
be set to 0 when new instances of <B>Country</B> are created. Property <I>z</I> 
will be defined for the class <B>Currency</B> if it does not already exist. It 
will be defined as a time varying property. This property value will be set to 
the default <B>Country</B> for new instances. 
<P>
<H4><A name=message>The MessageSetup Class</A></H4>
<P>This feed is used to add descriptive information to messages defined in your 
database. It can be used to supplement information supplied in using the <A 
href="clDataFeed.htm#property"><B>PropertySetup</B></A> 
feed or to describe methods that have been installed. 
<P>This feed uses the following fields: 
<P>
<UL type=disc>
  <LI><I>classId</I> - name of the class 
  <LI><I>message</I> - name of the message 
  <LI><I>keyType</I> - message can be thought of as a "key" 
  <LI><I>returnType</I> - type of object returned by message 
  <LI><I>containerType</I> - form object returned in (Object, List, IList, or 
  TS) 
  <LI><I>level</I> - usage level (Basic, Advanced, DBA) 
  <LI><I>function</I> - function type 
  <LI><I>tvFlag</I> - time-varying indicator (for methods) 
  <LI><I>brief</I> - brief description 
  <LI><I>description</I> - full description 
  <LI><I>paramList</I> - comma separated list of parameter types for keyword 
  messages </LI></UL>
<P>The fields can be supplied in any order as long as the header line indicates 
which fields are present. The <I>classId</I> and <I>message</I> fields must be 
present. 
<P>The <I>classId</I> and <I>message</I> fields identify the message. Both must 
be present and must identify a message that already exists. 
<P>The <I>keyType</I> field is optional and is used to indicate that the message 
can be thought of as a "key" for the class. Vision does not use keys explicitly 
but this field can be used as an indicator on schema based reports. Valid values 
for this field are <I>FULL</I> and <I>PARTIAL</I> indicating the message 
represents the only (FULL) key or a partial key. 
<P>The <I>returnType</I> field indicates the class of object returned by the 
message. The <I>containerType</I> field indicates the form of the object 
returned when the message returns a collection. Valid values are <I>List</I>, 
<I>IndexedList</I>, <I>TimeSeries</I>, and <I>Object</I> indicating the type of 
collection, if applicable. If no value or a bad value is supplied, the default 
value of <I>Object</I> is used, indicating that the value is <B>NOT</B> returned 
as a collection. 
<P>The <I>function</I> field is used to define a functional categorization for 
the message. By default, messages uploaded via this feed are set to a function 
type of <I>Data</I>. The <I>level</I> field is used to indicate expected user 
level for the message. Defined values are <I>Basic</I>, <I>Advanced</I>, or 
<I>DBA</I>. 
<P>The <I>tvFlag</I> field indicates if the message returns different values 
over time. If the message is a property or constant, this field is ignored since 
the time varying attribute is based on the type of property. If this message 
refers to a method, you can use this field to indicate that the method may 
return different values as of different dates by supplying the value Yes or 
True. By default, methods are not flagged as time-varying. 
<P>The <I>brief</I> field is used to define a brief description. The 
<I>description</I> field is used to define a long description. 
<P>The <I>paramList</I> field contains a comma-separated list of types, one for 
each parameter in binary and keyword messages. This field can also be used to 
set the index type for a message that return an IndexedList.

<H3><A name=globals>The GlobalsFeed Class</A></H3>
<P>The <B>GlobalsFeed</B> class is used to override the default settings for 
loading a data feed file. The overrides only apply to the next feed run. The 
<I>loadFromFile:</I> and <I>updateFromString:</I> messages can be used to load global values with this feed. The first line of the feed may contain the header line record however it is ignored as the fields are assumed to be in the following order:

<pre>
     option   | setting   | settingType
</pre>

where <I>option</I> is a configuration option such as 
<I>delimiter</I>, <I>fieldOrderList</I>, or <I>autoExpire</I> and <I>setting</I> 
is the value you wish to use as an override. The <I>settingType</I> is optional 
and is used to indicate the type of data supplied in the <I>setting</I> field 
such as <I>Date</I> or <I>DateOffset</I>. For example:
<pre>
     GlobalsFeed updateFromString: 
     "option      | setting        | settingType
      asofDate    | 9906           | Date
      autoExpire  | 1 businessDays | DateOffset
     " ; 
</pre>

<p>Note: the data must be supplied in this order. 
<P>The <B>GlobalsFeed</B> is used by <A href="pmaFeeds.htm#config">configuration files</A>. The Global options used in the built-in feeds are <A href="pmaFeeds.htm#config">described elsewhere</A>.

<H3><A name=purges>Purging Data Using DataFeeds</A></H3>
<P><B>DataFeed</B> classes can be used to flag entities as inactive 
(<B>MasterFeed</B> subclasses) and to purge actual <B>DataRecords</B> and points in time series properties (<B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> subclasses). To indicate 
that you want to use a feed to purge data, you can set the <I>enablePurge</I> 
flag prior to executing the feed. The next time the flagged feed is executed, it 
will be run in "purge" mode. After it executes, the purge flag is automatically 
disabled. 
<P>For example:
<pre>
     CurrencyMaster enablePurge ;
     CurrencyMaster updateFromString: 
     "id |
      CAD
     " ;
</pre>
flags the Canadian currency as inactive. 
<P>
<H4>MasterFeed Purges</H4>
<P>You cannot purge the entity instances associated with a master feed but you 
can flag them as inactive. If you set the <I>enablePurge</I> flag prior to 
running a <B>MasterFeed</B> update, all entities included in the feed will be 
flagged for deletion, performing the following steps: 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>The entity's <I>deletionFlag</I> property is set to TRUE. 
  <LI>The entity's <I>deletionDate</I> property is set to the current date. 
  <LI>The entity's <I>deletionReason</I> property is set to "Purge Enabled". 
  </LI></OL>Because the entity's <I>deletionFlag</I> has been set, the entity will 
no longer be included in the list returned by the <I>activeList</I> message. The 
entity will continue to be accessible via the <I>masterList</I> and 
<I>instanceList</I> messages as well as its class' naming dictionary. 
<P>If you want to store a specific reason for the entity's deletion, you can 
include the <I>terminateFlag</I> field in your feed. The value in this field 
will be used to update the <I>deletionReason</I> property in the entity. Note 
that if you include this field explicitly, you do not need to set the 
<I>enablePurge</I> option prior to executing the feed. 
<P>
<H4>EntityExtenderFeed Purges</H4>
<P><B>EntityExtenderFeed</B> classes can be used to purge information in a 
number of ways depending on the style of feed. If the feed is used to update 
time series properties defined directly for an <B>Entity</B> or <B>Bridge</B> 
class, the update will delete dates from each time series specified when the 
<I>enablePurge</I> option is set. If the feed is used to update a time series of 
<B>DataRecords</B>, the update will delete dates in this time series when the 
<I>enablePurge</I> option is set. When the feed is used to update a 
<B>DataRecord</B> containing time series properties, the update will delete 
dates from the individual time series specified when the <I>enablePurge</I> 
option is set. 
<P>The <I>entityId</I> value can be specified as *, indicating that you wish to 
purge all entities for the supplied date. The <I>date</I> value can also be 
specified as a *, indicating that you wish to purge all dates for the supplied 
entity. Alternatively, the date can be specified as a range in the form: <I>
<BLOCKQUOTE>date1:date2 (all dates between date1 and date2) <BR>date1: (all 
  dates from date1 on)<BR>:date2 (all dates through date2)<BR></BLOCKQUOTE></I>
<P>For example:
<pre>
     #--  Purge specific date for specific entity
     PricingFeed enablePurge;
     PricingFeed updateFromString: "id | date
     IBM | 990709
     " ;

     #--  All entities; explicit date
     PricingFeed enablePurge;
     PricingFeed updateFromString: "id | date
     * | 990709
     " ;

     #--  1 entity ; date range
     PricingFeed enablePurge;
     PricingFeed updateFromString: "id | date
     IBM | 990701 : 990729
     " ;

     #--  1 entity ; all points before a date    
     PricingFeed enablePurge;
     PricingFeed updateFromString: "id | date
     IBM | :990729
     " ;

     #--  1 entity ; all date
     PricingFeed enablePurge;
     PricingFeed updateFromString: "id | date
     IBM | *
     " ;
