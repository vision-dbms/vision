title: Vision Program Execution

<p>
<h3 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>Vision works by sending messages to objects. Every Vision <a href="Lang.htm#expression">expression</a>
is constructed in terms of building blocks of the form:</p>

<ul>
<p><i>object message</i></p>
</ul>

<p>For example, the expression:</p>

<ul>
<p><i>3.14 asInteger</i></p>
</ul>

<p>sends the <i>asInteger</i> message to a familiar looking number.</p>

<p>The result of sending a message to an object is itself an object. As
an object, it can be the target of a message. For example, the expression:</p>

<ul>
<p><i>3.14 asInteger sqrt</i></p>
</ul>

<p>sends the <i>sqrt</i> message to the object returned by the <i>asInteger</i>
message to that same familiar looking number. The Vision language can represent
numbers and strings directly, but where do other objects come from? Since
every name in a Vision expression is the name of a message, what object
receives the <i>gm</i> message in the following expression?</p>

<ul>
<p><i>gm sales</i></p>
</ul>

<p id="magic">
To answer these questions, Vision provides a special collection of variables
called the <b>Magic Words</b>.
These variables return objects that give every expression a 
<b id="context">Context</b>
in which to execute. There are ten magic words in
Vision -- <i>^current</i>, <i>^my</i>, <i>^self</i>, <i>^super</i>, <i>^here</i>,
<i>^global</i>, <i>^tmp</i>, <i>^today</i>, <i>^date</i>, and <i>^local</i>
-- and three kinds of context -- <i><a href="#blockContext">Block
Context</a></i>, <i><a href="#globalContext">Global Context</a></i>,
and <i><a href="#dynamicContext">Dynamic Context</a></i>.</p>

<p id="env">
<i><a href="#blockContext">Block Context</a></i> is the largest
and most complex of the contexts. Half of the magic words -- <i>^current</i>,
<i>^my</i>, <i>^self</i>, <i>^super</i>, <i>^here</i> -- return objects
related to the block context of an expression. Every expression 
executes in an <b>Environment</b>, a
default place to look for the implementation of a message as well as a
place to record the values of local variables and parameters. 
The <a href="#current"><i>^current</i> magic word</a> 
magic word returns the object filling that role. 
A block can be sent to
an object and asked to execute in the context of that object. When that
happens, the block needs a way to access messages defined in the environment
from which it came. 
The <a href="#my"><i>^my</i> magic word</a> provides that capability.
Whenever a block or message is sent to an object, Vision remembers the
object to which the block or message was sent. 
<a href="#self"><i>^self</i> magic word</a> 
returns that object. An expression sometimes needs to override the default
search rules Vision uses to locate messages. 
The <a href="#super"><i>^super</i></a> and 
<a href="#here"><i>^here</i></a>
magic words make that possible. </p>

<p><i><a href="#globalContext">Global Context</a></i> accesses
the fixed, global state of your Vision session. Three magic words supply
the global context for an expression -- <i>^global</i>, <i>^tmp</i>, and
<i>^today</i>. Of these, <i>^global</i> and <i>^tmp</i> are the most significant
since <i>^today</i> simply returns the start date of the current session.
When a Vision session starts, an initial top level object is derived from
your session's startup options. That object provides a view of the data
base and a workspace for the session. It is returned by the
<a href="#global"><i>^global</i> magic word</a>.
Any object created during a session and made accessible either
directly or indirectly from the <i>^global</i> object may be saved if the
session updates the data base. That is not desirable for objects that represent
intermediate results or inherently transient objects like connections to
files, processes, or services. To provide a purely temporary place to record
those objects, Vision provides an object that is not automatically saved
as part of an update. That object is derived from the <i>^global</i> object
and accessed via the <a href="#tmp"><i>^tmp</i> magic word</a>.

<p><i><a href="#dynamicContext">Dynamic Context</a></i> defines
your perspective on the data base. Two magic words provide the dynamic
context for an expression -- <i>^date</i> and <i>^local</i>. 
The <a href="#date"><i>^date</i>
magic word</a> provides an expression with a point in time from which it should
view the data base. It is changed by operations like <i>date evaluate:
[]. </i>The <i>^date</i> magic word is a special case of a more general
concept. Any part of an application can be written to behave in a perspective
dependent way. One of many examples is the target currency used to manipulate
and display monetary values. To implement a dynamic perspective, an application
needs to provide any expressions that depend on that perspective with access
to the values that define it. 
The <a href="#local"><i>^local</i> magic word</a> returns the
object that records those values. </p>

<p>The rest of this document describes these topics in detail.</p>

<h3 id="layers">Objects Layers</h2>

<p>The objects accessed and constructed as part of the context for a Vision
expression take special advantage of the Vision object model. This section
reviews that model.</p>

<p>Vision objects are constructed in layers. The layers of an object correspond
to its <b><a href="Fund.htm#class">Class</a></b> structure. 
Each layer 
provides an environment that
adds the properties and methods defined at the corresponding level of the
class hierarchy. The outermost layer of an object represents the most specialized
class in the hierarchy. When a message is sent to an object, the layers
of the object are searched for a definition of that message, starting at
the outermost.  This is known as 
<span id="resolve"><b>Resolving the Message</b></span>.

<p><b>Classes</b> provide a template for constructing similar objects.
<b>Layers</b> provide an implementation for those objects. Since object
layers implement object classes in the natural way, the distinction between
classes and layers can be ignored in most cases. Object layers provide
a more flexible form of inheritance, however, and that flexibility is exploited
by blocks and methods to implement their behavior.</p>

<p>The easiest way to understand object layers and their relationship to
object classes is to think of classes as tables and layers as rows in those
tables. A class provides definitions for the columns of the table while
a layer holds the property values associated with a particular instance
of that class. Just as every class except <i>Object</i> inherits the definitions
of properties and methods from its superclass, every layer except those
at <i>Object</i> inherits property values from a <i>super</i>-layer associated
with the object's superclass. That behavior is provided automatically by
Vision. While there is no ambiguity concerning the superclass from which
a particular layer inherits, there is ambiguity regarding the super-layer.
That ambiguity is resolved when the layer is created. For example, when
an object is created with the <i>new</i> or
<i>createInstance</i> message, Vision automatically
creates a new layer for each class in the object's superclass chain. It
links those newly created layers together so that each layer can uniquely
find its superior. For example:<pre>
  Object createSubclass: "MySubclass" ;
  !instance1 <- MySubclass createInstance;
</pre>
creates <i>instance1</i> with two layers -- one associated with <i>MySubclass</i>
and the other with <i>Object</i>. Each of these layers stores the values
for properties defined at its associated class. For example, if <i>MySubclass</i>
defines two fixed properties,<i> x</i> and<i> y</i>,</p>

<ul>
<pre>MySubclass defineFixedProperty: 'x';
MySubclass defineFixedProperty: 'y';</pre>
</ul>

<p>and <i>Object</i> defines the fixed property, <i>code</i>:</p>

<ul>
<pre>Object defineFixedProperty: 'code';</pre>
</ul>

<p>the layer of <i>instance1</i> associated with <i>MySubclass</i> stores
<i>instance1</i>'s values for <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
instance1 :x <- 23;
instance1 :y <- 92;
</pre>
</ul>

<p>while the layer associated with <i>Object</i> stores the value for <i>code</i>:</p>

<ul>
<pre>instance1 :code &lt;- &quot;instance1&quot;;</pre>
</ul>

<span id="specialization"> </span>
<p>Instantiation is not the only mechanism by which object layers are created.
The other is object specialization. Object specialization adds a layer
to an existing object. Internally, object specialization is the mechanism
Vision uses to store and access the local variables and parameters of a
block. Externally, it is the basis for subclass creation and a number of
important Vision messages. One of those messages is <i>extendBy:</i>. The
<i>extendBy:</i> message is defined for all objects. It takes a single
argument which is expected to be a block. It returns its recipient with
an added layer. That added layer contains the values of the local variables
computed during the execution of the block:<pre>
  !instance1a <- instance1
    extendBy: [ !greeting <- "Hi, I'm instance 1a" ];
</pre>
<p>Unlike class specialization which inherits only the definitions of messages
from a superclass, adding a layer to an object produces an object that
inherits both the message definitions and property values of the original
object. For example, the value of:</p>

<ul>
<pre>instance1a x</b> </pre>
</ul>

<p>is <b>23</b> -- the same as <i>instance1</i>'s value of <i>x</i>. If
an operation on <i>instance1<b> </b></i>changes the value of <i>x</i>,
<i>instance1a</i> sees the new value; if an operation on <i>instance1a</i>
changes the value of <i>x</i>, <i>instance1</i> sees the change. 
<p>
Multiple
layers can inherit from the same layer. For example, the expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre>!instance1b &lt;- instance1 extendBy: [ !z &lt;- 16.5 ];</pre>
</ul>

<p>creates another specialization of <i>instance1</i> which, along with
<i>instance1a</i>, shares all of <i>instance1</i>'s messages and values.</p>

<p>Objects created using object specialization operations like <i>extendBy:</i>
are full fledged Vision objects in all respects. For example, <i>instance1a</i>
is a member of a unique subclass of <i>MySubclass</i> which can be instantiated
by sending the <i>createInstance</i> message to <i>instance1a</i>:<pre>
  !instance2a <- instance1a createInstance;
  instance2a :greeting <- "Hi, I'm instance 2a" ;
  instance2a :x <- -17.6;
  instance2a :y <- 2.718;
</pre>

<p>The layers of any object can be peeled away. Every object responds to
the <i>super</i> message by removing its outermost layer and returning
the object that results. The <i>super</i> message does not modify its recipient
-- it simply returns its next deepest layer. For example,</p>

<ul>
<pre>instance1a super</pre>
</ul>

<p>returns the same object as <i>instance1</i> -- the object which it specialized.</p>

<p>The ability to dynamically add and remove layers of an object is key
to the operation of Vision programs.</p>

<h3 id="blockContext">Block Context</h2>

<p><i>Block context</i> is the largest and most complex of the contexts.
Every expression needs a default place to look for the implementation of
a message as well as a place to record the values of local variables and
parameters. A block can be sent to an object and asked to execute in the
context of that object. When that happens, the block needs a way to access
messages defined in the environment from which it came. Whenever a block
or message is sent to an object, Vision needs to remember the object to
which the block or message was sent. Finally, an expression sometimes needs
a way to override the default search rules Vision uses to locate messages.
All of these issues are dealt with using the rules of block context described
in this section. Topics described in this section include:</p>

<ul>
<p><a href="#current">The <i>^current</i> Object</a></p>

<p><a href="#operate">Using Blocks To
Operate On Objects</a></p>

<p><a href="#methods">Using Blocks To Define
Methods</a></p>

<p><a href="#super">Using <i>^super</i> to Access Superclass
Definitions</a></p>

<p><a href="#here">Using <i>^here</i> to Ignore Subclass
Definitions</a></p>
</ul>

<h4 id="current">The <i>^current</i> Object</h4>

<p>One of the first questions this document asked was how Vision knows
where to find <i>gm</i> in the expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre>gm sales</pre>
</ul>

<p>Vision interprets all names as messages to some object. By that rule,
the symbol<i> gm</i> is the name of a message. As a message, it must be
sent to an object to produce a result. What object is that? The answer
is the object returned by the <i>^current</i> magic word. Any Vision expression
can begin with the name of a unary message. If it does, that message is
understood to be a message to <i>^current</i>. As a result, <i>gm sales</i>
is a shorthand for and equivalent to:</p>

<ul>
<pre>^current gm sales</pre>
</ul>

<p>and <i>gm earnings / gm shares</i> is a shorthand for:</p>

<ul>
<pre>^current gm earnings / ^current gm shares</pre>
</ul>

<p>Every Vision expression needs a default place to look for the implementation
of a message as well as a place to record the values of local variables
and parameters. <i>^current</i> returns that object. 
<span id="interactiveCurrent"></span>
For expressions that you type interactively, <i>^current</i> returns the 
<a href="#global">top
level object accessed when you started your Vision session</a>. If you
type the expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre>showMessages</pre>
</ul>

<p>in your interactive session, you will get a list of the messages defined
at your top level workspace.</p>

<p><i>^current</i> is only understood as the default recipient for the
initial unary message in a message expression. If you need to send a binary
or keyword message to <i>^current</i>, you must explicitly include <i>^current</i>
as part of your expression. For example, if you want to send the <i>print:</i>
message to <i>^current</i>, you must type:</p>

<ul>
<pre>^current print: aWidth</pre>
</ul>

<p>If you enter:</p>

<ul>
<pre>print: aWidth</pre>
</ul>

<p>you will get a syntax error from Vision.</p>

<p>Not every expression you give Vision to process is executed immediately
using the messages available from your top level workspace. In fact, most
expressions are part of blocks and methods that are executed only when
appropriate. Blocks and methods also have access to a <i>^current</i> object.
Their <i>^current</i> object is based on their execution environment.</p>

<p>Basically, the purpose of the <i>^current</i> object is to provide a
place to store and retrieve the values of the local variables of a block.
Because methods are blocks too, the same statement applies to them as well.
Every block carries with it a list of the local definitions it requires.
When you enter an expression like <b>!x &lt;- 10</b> in a block, you are
stating that the block requires a fixed property whose name is <b>x</b>.
The local definitions associated with the block are used to construct the
<i>^current</i> object that the block will use when it executes. </p>

<p>Because <i>^current</i> is an object, it needs to inherit from somewhere.
It makes sense to have it inherit from someplace convenient. Consider the
following Vision code fragment:</p>

<ul>
<pre>!x &lt;- 10;
!y &lt;- 5;
[ !x &lt;- 20;
  x print;
  y print;
] value;
x print;</pre>
</ul>

<p>When executed, this code displays the following result:</p>

<pre>       20        5       10</pre>

<p>What allows Vision to produce this result? Inside
the block, we have defined a local variable named <b>x</b> and executed two
expressions. Those expressions ask Vision to print the objects obtained
by sending the messages <b>x</b> and <b>y</b> to the block's <i>^current</i>
object. Because the block provides its own definition and value for <b>x</b>,
it is no surprise that the first value displayed is <b>20</b>, the value
locally assigned to <b>x </b>inside the block. The second value displayed
-- <b>5</b> -- is the value of <b>y</b> defined immediately outside the
block. That is convenient, useful, and an example of what is known in programming
language jargon as lexical scope. Sending the <b>value</b> message to the
block asked the block to construct a <i>^current</i> object for itself
that inherits from the <i>^current</i> object available where the block
is defined. Note that the local value of <b>20</b> for <b>x</b> only applies
inside the block. The value of <b>x</b> outside the block remains unchanged,
as demonstrated by the third value displayed.</p>

<p>The <i>^current</i> object constructed for the benefit of the block
is constructed by adding a layer to an existing object using object specialization.
In this case, that object is the <i>^current</i> object available at the
spot the block is defined. Within the block, that layer can be removed
using the <i>super</i> message. For example:</p>

<ul>
<pre>!x &lt;- 10;
[ !x &lt;- 20;
  x print;
  super x print;
] value;</pre>
</ul>

<p>displays the result:</p>

<pre>       20        10</pre>

<p>The <i>^current</i> object can also be 
<a href="#returningCurrent">returned
from the block</a> or passed as an argument, but that is a topic for another
section.</p>

<p>As noted, variables created within a block can be accessed from within
the block and from any new blocks defined within that block; however, these
variables are not available outside the block. For example, when the code
fragment:</p>

<ul>
<pre>myList count &gt; 100
 ifTrue: [ !output &lt;- &quot;This is a big list&quot; ]
ifFalse: [&nbsp;!output &lt;- &quot;This is a small list&quot; ];
output</pre>
</ul>

<p>is executed, the final <i>output</i> message will not be found. Although
both blocks passed to the <i>ifTrue:ifFalse:</i> message define local variables
called <i>output</i>, neither of these definitions is available at the
spot where the final <i>output</i> message is sent. The previous program
could be rewritten as:</p>

<ul>
<pre>myList count &gt; 100
 ifTrue: [ !output &lt;- &quot;This is a big list&quot;;
           output
         ]
ifFalse: [ !output &lt;- &quot;This is a small list&quot;;
           output
         ]</pre>
</ul>

<p>or:</p>

<ul>
<pre>!output;
myList count &gt; 100
 ifTrue: [ :output &lt;- &quot;This is a big list&quot; ]
ifFalse: [&nbsp;:output &lt;- &quot;This is a small list&quot; ];
output</pre>
</ul>

<p>or:</p>

<ul>
<pre>!output &lt;- myList count &gt;&nbsp;100
 ifTrue: [ &quot;This is a big list&quot; ]
ifFalse: [&nbsp;&quot;This is a small list&quot; ];
output</pre>
</ul>

<p>or:</p>

<ul>
<pre>!output &lt;- &quot;This is a small list&quot;;
myList count &gt; 100
 ifTrue: [ :output &lt;- &quot;This is a big list&quot; ];
output</pre>
</ul>

<p>All of these program fragments produce the same result. The last three
produce their result by updating the value of the <i>output</i> property
defined at the same level as the blocks in these examples.</p>

<p>The examples presented thus far are examples in which the <i>^current</i>
object constructed for a block inherits from the environment in which the
block was defined. Blocks passed to messages like <i>value</i>,<i> whileTrue:</i>,
<i>ifTrue:ifFalse:</i> and its variants all behave this way. These messages
implement conditional control structures similar to those found in traditional
programming languages. The expressions in the blocks used with these messages
should see the same collection of names as seen by their non-conditional
brethren. Constructing a <i>^current</i> object that inherits from the
environment of the block's definition produces that behavior. </p>

<h4 id="operate">Using Blocks To Operate
On Objects</h4>

<p>It is often useful to send a number of messages to the same object.
For example, you could write code like:</p>

<ul>
<pre>gm sales print;
gm assets print;
gm earnings print;</pre>
</ul>

<p>to send a number of different messages to the same object. To allow
you to 'factor out' the repeated recipient, Vision provides the <i>do:</i>
message. Using the <i>do:</i> message, you can write the same code as:</p>

<ul>
<pre>gm
do: [ sales print;
      assets print;
      earnings print;
    ];</pre>
</ul>
<p id="contextSwitch">The block supplied to the <i>do:</i> message will need a <i>^current</i>
object when it is run; however, in this example that <i>^current</i> object
does not inherit from the environment of the block's definition -- it inherits
from the object <i>gm</i> supplied to the <i>do:</i> message. The <i>do:</i>
message is one of a number of important Vision messages that behave this
way. When Vision constructs a block's <i>^current</i> object, it gets to
decide which object <i>^current</i> should inherit from based on what it
is going to do with the block. In this case, that object is a dynamically
supplied one.</p>
<p>
Messages such as <i>do:</i> which dynamically change the <i>^current</i>
object are performing a <b>Context Switch</b>.  Other messages that
dynamically switch the context include <i>send:</i>, <i>extendBy:</i>
and most of the <i>Collection</i> messages that require a block as 
a parameter.
<p>
A block whose <i>^current</i> object does not inherit from the environment
in which the block was defined still has access to that environment. Consider
the following code fragment:</p>

<ul>
<pre>!industrySales &lt;- gm industry sales;
gm
do: [ name print;
      sales print;
      (sales / ^my industrySales) printNL</pre>

<pre>    ];</pre>
</ul>

<p id="my">Whenever Vision creates a block's <i>^current</i> object from a dynamically
specified object, it makes the object that <i>^current</i> would have inherited
from available as the value of the <i>^my</i> magic word. Using the <i>^my</i>
magic word, it is possible to retrieve values from the environment in which
the block appears. In this example, <i>^my</i> returns the object that
understands the <i>gm</i> message and defines the <i>industrySales</i>
local variable.</p>

<p id="self">Whenever Vision creates a block's <i>^current</i> object from a dynamically
specified object, it also makes that dynamic object available as the value
of the <i>^self</i> magic word. Using the <i>^self</i> magic word, you
can access the dynamic object without any of the local redefinitions made
by the block. This is often helpful. If <i>gm</i> already responds to the
<i>eps</i> message, that definition will be hidden by the local one in
the following example:</p>

<ul>
<pre>gm
do: [ !eps &lt;- earnings &gt; 0 
         ifTrue: [ earnings / shares ] ifFalse: [ 0 ];
      &quot;Adjusted eps = &quot; print; eps printNL;
    ];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>One way you can access the original definition is by sending the <i>eps</i>
message to <i>^self</i>. The following code displays the values returned
by both the original and locally redefined <i>eps</i> messages:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
gm
do: [ !eps &lt;- earnings &gt; 0 
         ifTrue: [ earnings / shares ] ifFalse: [ 0 ];
      &quot;Original eps = &quot; print; ^self eps printNL;
      &quot;Adjusted eps = &quot; print; eps printNL;
    ];</pre>
</ul>

<p id="stripLayer">At this point, you should be telling yourself that there is another
way to achieve the same result. 
Because
<i>^current</i> is constructed as a specialization of the dynamic object
returned by <i>^self</i>, you could also write:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
gm
do: [ !eps &lt;- earnings &gt; 0 
         ifTrue: [ earnings / shares ] ifFalse: [ 0 ];
      &quot;Original eps = &quot; print; super eps printNL;
      &quot;Adjusted eps = &quot; print; eps printNL;
    ];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Because <i>super</i> removes the outer layer of an object, <i>^current
super</i> returns exactly the same object as <i>^self.</i> If you use the
<i>super</i> message, however, you need to remove the correct number of
layers. In this case, you needed to remove one layer -- the layer added
to form <i>^current</i> for the top level block. When your expression appears
in a more deeply nested block, you need to remove more layers. The following
code would not produce the result you expect:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
gm
do: [ !eps &lt;- earnings &gt; 0 
           ifTrue: [ earnings / shares ] ifFalse: [ 0 ];
      eps &gt; 0 ifTrue: [
        &quot;Original eps = &quot; print; super eps printNL;
        &quot;Adjusted eps = &quot; print; eps printNL;
      ];
    ];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>As before, the <i>super</i> message removes one layer from <i>^current</i>;
however, at the point where this <i>super</i> message is sent, <i>^current</i>
refers to the current environment of the <i>ifTrue:</i> block. Inside the
<i>ifTrue:</i> block, you need to remove two layers to get back to the
dynamic object -- the layer added by the <i>ifTrue:</i> block and the layer
added by the <i>do:</i> block. To get the right answer, you need to use:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
gm
do: [ !eps &lt;- earnings &gt; 0 
         ifTrue: [ earnings / shares ] ifFalse: [ 0 ];
      eps &gt; 0 ifTrue: [
        &quot;Original eps = &quot; print; super super eps printNL;
        &quot;Adjusted eps = &quot; print; eps printNL;
      ];
    ];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>or you need to use <i>^self</i>:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
gm
do: [ !eps &lt;- earnings &gt; 0 
           ifTrue: [ earnings / shares ] ifFalse: [ 0 ];
      eps &gt; 0 ifTrue: [
        &quot;Original eps = &quot; print; ^self eps printNL;
        &quot;Adjusted eps = &quot; print; eps printNL;
      ];
    ];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>When to use <i>^current</i> and when to use <i>^self</i> is a recurring
question in Vision programming. For operations like <i>do:</i>, where <i>^current</i>
always inherits from <i>^self</i>, you can use either and usually get the
right answer. In some cases, however, you need to be sensitive to the magic
word you choose. A good rule of thumb is to use <i>^self</i> when you are
sending a message to the dynamic object and to allow Vision to use <i>^current</i>,
which it does by default for unary messages, when you are accessing a local
variable or parameter of the block. </p>

<p>As noted, Vision makes extensive use of blocks that inherit from dynamically
specified objects. A number of messages are defined at <b>Object</b> that
use blocks this way. The <i>do:</i> message illustrated here is one of
those messages. It evaluates a block in the context of a dynamically specified
object and returns that object. The <i>send:</i> message is another. It
returns the value of the final expression in the block. 
<span id="returningCurrent"></span>
The
<i>extendBy:</i> message, discussed in the
<a href="#layers">object layers section of this document</a>, 
is a third. It returns the <i>^current</i>
object used by the block while it was being evaluated. In fact, the expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
gm
extendBy: [ !eps &lt;- earnings / shares ]
</pre>
</ul>

<p>and:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
gm
send: [ !eps &lt;- earnings / shares ;
        ^current
      ]
</pre>
</ul>

<p>produce exactly the same result -- an object that inherits all of the
property values and messages of <i>gm</i> along with an additional property
named <i>eps</i>.</p>

<p>Vision's collection iteration and query operations also make use of
dynamically specified block inheritance. The <i>do:</i>, <i>send:</i>,
and <i>extendBy:</i> messages are all redefined by the collection classes
to apply their block argument to each element of the collection. For example,
the code fragment:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
4 sequence
do: [ print;
      sqrt print;
      newLine print;
    ];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>displays the square roots of the first four integers. All of the query,
sorting, grouping, and aggregation operations accept one or more blocks
that are also applied to the collection's elements using the dynamic inheritance
rules described here. For example, </p>

<ul>
<pre>
Company masterList
select: [ sales &gt; 10000 ].
sortDown: [ sales ].
do: [ name print: 40;
      sales printNL;
    ];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>evaluates all of the initial unary messages in its blocks in the context
of the elements of the lists it is processing.</p>

<p>Using dynamic inheritance to construct the <i>^current</i> object for
a block is a convenient shorthand. The messages that use dynamic inheritance
all operate on one or more objects. The blocks they accept as their arguments
specify operations to be performed or values needed for that object or
collection of objects. By arranging the block's affairs so that it inherits
from the object with which it is working, the block gains direct access
to the information it needs. That principle also applies to the definition
of methods.</p>

<h4 id="methods">Using Blocks To Define Methods</h4>

<p>When you define a method, you are defining code that runs in response
to a message. Because that code is a block, it will have a <i>^current</i>
object constructed for it when it runs. To construct that object, Vision
needs to choose an object from which it will inherit. The following examples
illustrate how Vision makes that choice.</p>

<p>To start with, assume that <i>Subclass1</i> and <i>Subclass2</i> are
defined by the following Vision code:<pre>
  Object createSubclass: "Subclass1" ;
  Subclass1 createSubclass: "Subclass2" ;

  Subclass1 define: 'message1'
            toBe: "You got the definition of message1 at Subclass1" ;
  Subclass1 define: 'message2'
            toBe: "You got the definition of message2 at Subclass1" ;

  Subclass2 define: 'message1'
            toBe: "You got the definition of message1 at Subclass2" ;
</pre>
and that <i>Subclass2</i> defines a method that displays the values
of <i>message1</i> and <i>message2</i> as follows:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Subclass2
defineMethod:
[ | displayStuff |
    message1 printNL;
    message2 printNL;
];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Evaluating the expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre>Subclass2 displayStuff</pre>
</ul>

<p>produces the result:</p>

<ul>
<pre>You got the definition of message1 at Subclass2
You got the definition of message2 at Subclass1</pre>
</ul>

<p>This is probably what you expected. Since <i>message1</i> is defined
at <i>Subclass2</i>, sending <i>message1</i> to an instance of <i>Subclass2</i>
finds that definition. Since <i>message2</i> is defined at <i>Subclass1</i>
but not at <i>Subclass2</i>, sending <i>message2</i> to an instance of
<i>Subclass2</i> finds the inherited definition at <i>Subclass1</i>. </p>

<p>Suppose <i>Subclass1</i> defines a similar method:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Subclass1
defineMethod:
[ | displayStuff1 |
    message1 printNL;
    message2 printNL;
];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Because <i>Subclass2</i> inherits from <i>Subclass1</i>, you can evaluate
the expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre>Subclass2 displayStuff1</pre>
</ul>

<p>When you do, you get the result:</p>

<ul>
<pre>You got the definition of message1 at Subclass1
You got the definition of message2 at Subclass1</pre>
</ul>

<p>This may <b>not</b> be what you expected. Even though the <i>displayStuff1</i>
message was sent to an instance of <i>Subclass2</i>, Vision found <i>Subclass1</i>'s
definition for <i>message1</i>. It did not find <i>Subclass2</i>'s redefinition.
Apparently, when <i>displayStuff1</i> is run in this case, it is sending
<i>message1</i> to an instance of <i>Subclass1</i>, not of <i>Subclass2</i>.
That is in fact the case. When Vision runs a method, it constructs the
<i>^current</i> object for that method so that it inherits from the object
layer associated with the subclass that defines the method, not the object
layer to which the message was sent. In this example, that is the layer
of <i>Subclass2</i> associated with <i>Subclass1</i>.</p>

<p>When Vision executes a method in response to a message, <i>^self</i>
is set to the object to which the message was sent. <i>^self</i> in Vision
is similar to <i>self</i> in Smalltalk and <i>this</i> in C++. Using <i>^self</i>
instead of <i>^current</i>, <i>displayStuff1</i> can be rewritten as:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Subclass1
defineMethod:
[ | displayStuff1 |
    ^self message1 printNL;
    ^self message2 printNL;
];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Using this definition of <i>displayStuff1</i>, when you evaluate the
expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre>Subclass2 displayStuff1</pre>
</ul>

<p>you get the result:</p>

<ul>
<pre>You got the definition of message1 at Subclass2
You got the definition of message2 at Subclass1</pre>
</ul>

<p>which is probably what you expected to see.</p>

<p>As these examples illustrate, when you write a method, you need to consider
when to use <i>^self</i> and when to use <i>^current</i>. A good rule of
thumb is to use <i>^self</i> when you are sending a message to the object
used to invoke your method and <i>^current</i>, which Vision uses by default
for unary messages, when you are accessing a local variable or parameter
of the method or one of its nested blocks. When you use <i>^self</i>, you
are giving Vision access to all of the definitions and redefinitions available
from the object used to invoke your method. In contrast, when you use <i>^current</i>,
either explicitly or implicitly, you are telling Vision to ignore the class
of the recipient and just use the definitions available locally in the
method, the class at which the method is defined, and any superclasses
of that class. Except when you are accessing the value of a local variable
or parameter, that is probably not what you intended. If it is, 
<a href="#here">the
<i>^here</i> magic word, described below</a>, is a better choice.</p>

<p>When Vision executes a method in response to a message, it also sets
the <i>^my</i> magic word. In these examples, <i>^my</i> refers to the
object that understands the <i>Subclass1</i> and <i>Subclass2</i> messages.
This is exactly the same behavior as described for <i>do:</i> and its kin.
When Vision changes the default search path for a block to something other
than the block's definition environment, it arranges for <i>^my</i> to
return the definition environment of the block. You will probably never
need to use <i>^my</i> to access the environment that actually defined
the method, but you can and it behaves consistently.</p>

<h4 id="super">Using <i>^super</i> to Access Superclass
Definitions</h4>

<p>In an object-oriented system, subclasses are used to implement more
specialized behavior than their superclasses. One way that is done is by
overriding a superclass' definition of a message in a subclass. Sometimes
the override provides a completely new definition of the message that has
nothing to do with the superclass' implementation. More often, its intent
is to retain the behavior of the original message while adding the special
processing required by the subclass. </p>

<p>The initialization of a new instance is a common application for this
kind of specialization. For example, when Vision creates an object using
the <i>new</i> or
<i>createInstance</i> message, it sends the <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i>
message to the newly created object:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Object
defineMethod:
[ | new |
   ^self clusterNew initializeGlobalInstanceProperties
];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>The intent of the <i>intializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i> is to ask
the object to assign meaningful initial values to its properties. <i>Object</i>
provides an implementation of <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i>
that takes care of the properties defined at <i>Object</i>:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Object
defineMethod:
[ | initializeGlobalInstanceProperties |
   ^self :baseObject &lt;- ^self;
   ^self :creationDate &lt;- ^today;
   ^self
];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Every class that needs the services of <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i>
is expected to override its implementation to take care of its own needs.
In taking care of itself, however, it cannot ignore its superclasses. For
example, the implementation of <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i>
at <i>Object</i> must still be called if methods that rely on the validity
of <i>baseObject</i> and <i>creationDate</i> are to continue to work. To
satisfy this need, a method needs a way to call an implementation that
it overrides.</p>

<p>The <i>^super</i> magic word provides the needed mechanism. The following
code fragment shows the definition of <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i>
at a subclass of <i>Object</i>:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Object createSubclass: &quot;Entity&quot;;

Entity
defineMethod:
[|initializeGlobalInstanceProperties|
   ^super initializeGlobalInstanceProperties;
   ^self :aliases &lt;- ^self defaultInstance aliases clusterNew;
   ^self
];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>The first line in this method uses <i>^super</i> to invoke the implementation
of <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i> inherited from <i>Object</i>;
the rest of the method takes care of <i>Entity</i>'s special needs. This
technique is recursive. If a subclass of <i>Entity</i> needs to override
this message, it can use the same technique to ensure that <i>Entity</i>'s
version of this message is run. When the version of <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i>
at <i>Entity</i> is called, it will take care of calling the version at
<i>Object</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>^super</i> magic word is a cross between <i>^self</i> and <i>^current</i>.
It is a different from the other magic words you have seen because it behaves
differently depending on whether you ask for its value or send it a message.
If you ask for its value or return it as the result of an expression, <i>^super</i>
is indistinguishable from <i>^self</i>. For example, the expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre>^self == ^super</pre>
</ul>

<p>always returns <b>TRUE<i>. </i></b>When you send a message
to <i>^super</i>, however, Vision starts searching for the message at <i>^current</i>.
By starting at <i>^current</i>, the search is restricted to the class and
superclasses of the class that defined the current method. In the case
of <i>^super</i>, Vision looks for the <i>second</i> definition of the
message. When used to access a message definition hidden by a subclass,
the first definition found on the path from <i>^current</i> is presumably
the definition of the method that is currently running. Since calling it
again would simply put Vision into an infinite loop, that is not the version
Vision wants to find. For example, when Vision executes the <i>^super initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i>
expression inside <i>Entity</i>'s definition of <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i>,
the first implementation of <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i> is
the one at <i>Entity</i>. Skipping the first definition allows Vision to
proceed up the superclass chain to the hidden definition that <i>^super</i>
needs to find -- in this case the one at <i>Object</i>.</p>

<p>Once the desired message implementation is found, <i>^super</i> is once
again indistinguishable from <i>^self</i>. Even though <i>Entity</i>'s
definition of <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i> began its <i>^super
initializeGlobalInstanceProperties </i>search from <i>^current</i> and
not from <i>^self</i>, <i>^self</i> inside the method at <i>Object</i>
references the same object as <i>^self</i> inside the method at <i>Entity</i>.
If the whole process illustrated in this example were initiated by the
code:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Entity createSubclass: &quot;Company&quot;;

!myCompany &lt;- Company createInstance;
</pre>
</ul>

<p>the value of <i>^self</i> seen inside the <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i>
method defined at <i>Object</i> is the instance of class<i> Company</i>
created by the <i>createInstance</i> message -- not the <i>^current</i> object created
for the benefit of <i>Entity</i>'s implementation of <i>initializeGlobalInstanceProperties</i>.</p>

<p>Although their names are similar, the <i>^super</i> magic word and the
<i>super</i> message do not do the same thing and are generally not interchangeable.
<i>^super</i> is a magic word that controls how Vision uses <i>^self</i>
and <i>^current</i> to search for a message. Its intent is to allow a method
to call a superclass' version of itself. In all other respects, it is synonymous
with <i>^self</i>. In contrast, <i>super</i> is a message that removes
the outermost layer from an arbitrary object. While 
<a href="#stripLayer">removing
a layer from an object can sometimes be used to skip a particular message
definition</a>, removing that layer also makes subclass information associated
with that layer unavailable to the recipient of the message. The <i>super</i>
message is intended for use in cases where that consequence is acceptable
or desirable. Those cases typically involve removing extensions added by
operations like <i>extendBy:</i> and <i>groupedBy:</i> and implementing
operations like <i>showMessagesX</i> that must examine each layer of
an object. </p>

<h4 id="here">Using <i>^here</i> to Ignore Subclass Definitions</h4>

<p>While the ability to override the implementation of a message in a subclass
is a powerful capability, sometimes it is too powerful. When you write
a method that sends a message to <i>^self</i>, the message can be reimplemented
by any of the classes between the class of <i>^self</i> and the class at
which your method is defined. When you write a method that sends a message
to <i>^current</i>, you restrict your search to the local state of your
method, the class at which your method is defined, and the superclasses
of that class; however, any methods you call by sending a message to <i>^current</i>
will not have access to the subclass information associated with your method's
value of <i>^self</i>. There needs to be a middle ground. The <i>^here</i>
magic word provides that middle ground.</p>

<p>The <i>^here</i> magic word is another <i>^self -- ^current</i> hybrid
that evaluates to <i>^self</i> when asked for its value or passed as a
parameter but that searches for messages beginning with <i>^current</i>.
In fact, the only difference between <i>^here</i> and <i>^super</i> is
that <i>^here</i> returns the first definition of a message it finds while
<i>^super</i> returns the second.</p>

<p><i>^here</i> is intended to assist you in modularizing code. It is designed
to help in cases where a large method should be broken in several smaller
methods or where a collection of related methods all require the services
of a common set of helper methods. The use of <i>^here</i> guarantees that
these methods can call each other without danger of subclass override and
without losing the subclass information associated with the recipient of
the message that invoked the method. For example, the use of <i>^here</i>
in the following method fragments:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
MyClass
defineMethod:
[ | doItThisWay |
   ^here doThisWayOrThatWaySetup;
   ...
].

defineMethod:
[ | doItThatWay |
   ^here doThisWayOrThatWaySetup;
   ...
].

defineMethod:
[ | doThisWayOrThatWaySetup |
   ...
   ^self goThisWayOrThatWay;
   ^self whatAmI print;
   ...
];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>insures that <i>doItThisWay</i> and <i>doItThatWay</i> will always find
the <i>doThisWayOrThatWaySetup</i> method defined at <i>MyClass</i> regardless
of how that method might be redefined by the subclasses of <i>MyClass</i>.
The use of <i>^here</i> also guarantees that the expression <i>^self goThisWayOrThatWay</i>
in <i>doItThisWayOrThatWay</i> will always access to the full recipient
of the <i>doItThisWay</i> or <i>doItThatWay</i> message -- something it
would not have if <i>^current</i> were used instead of <i>^here</i>. For
example, executing the following code:</p>

<ul>
<pre>MyClass createSubclass: &quot;MySubClass&quot;;

MySubClass doItThisWay</pre>
</ul>

<p>will cause:</p>

<ul>
<pre>^self whatAmI print </pre>
</ul>

<p>in the definition of <i>doThisWayOrThatWaySetup</i> to display:</p>

<ul>
<pre>MySubClass</pre>
</ul>

<p>in addition to whatever else these methods do.</p>

<h3 id="globalContext">Global Context</h2>

<p><i>Global context</i> accesses the fixed, global state of your Vision
session. Three magic words supply the global context for an expression
-- <i>^global</i>, <i>^tmp</i>, and <i>^today</i>. Of these, 
<i><a href="#global">^global</a></i>
and <i><a href="#tmp">^tmp</a></i> are the most significant since
<span id="today"> </span>
<i>^today</i> simply returns the start date of the current session. When
a Vision session starts, an initial object is derived from the session's
startup options. That object provides a view of the data base and a workspace
for the session. It is returned by the <i>^global</i> magic word. Any object
created during a session and made accessible either directly or indirectly
from the <i>^global</i> object may be saved if the session updates the
data base. That is not desirable for objects that represent intermediate
results or inherently transient objects like connections to files, processes,
or services. To provide a purely temporary place to record those objects,
Vision provides an object that is not automatically saved as part of an
update. That object is derived from the <i>^global</i> object and accessed
via the <i>^tmp</i> magic word.</p>

<span><i>^global</i></span>

<p id="global">Every Vision data base is structured as a collection of <a href="Running.htm#ospace">object
spaces</a>. In addition to organizing a Vision data base on disk, each
object space remembers a special <b>Top Level Object</b> whose messages
return other objects from the data base. The top level objects associated
with the object spaces are starting points for navigation in a Vision data
base.</p>

<p>When you start a Vision session, you have the option of specifying which
object space you want to use as your starting point. The object space you
select determines the top level object you will be using. If you do not
specify an object space, Vision constructs a temporary one for you. In
that case, Vision derives a top level object for you by adding a layer
to the top level object associated with object space 3. The following diagram
illustrates the inheritance structure for the top level object you get:</p>

<pre>
              top-level space       (temporary or explicit object space)
                    |
                    |
                    V
              object space 3        (shared application core)
                    |
                    |
                    V
              object space 2        (shared built-in core)
                    |
                    |
                    V
                 Object
</pre>

<p>Whether you explicitly select an object space or Vision implicitly creates
one for you, the top level object associated with that object space is
always returned by the <i>^global</i> magic word. <a href="#interactiveCurrent">As
noted earlier</a>, the same object is also returned by the <i>^current</i>
magic word when you are evaluating interactive Vision expressions.</p>

<p>The top level object responds to messages that return the default instances
of built-in classes like <i>Object</i>, <i>Integer</i>, and <i>String</i>
as well as the default instances of application classes like <i>Company</i>
that you or your organization add to the data base. To add new objects
and classes to a data base, you modify your top level object or an object
accessible from it. For example, the expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre>Object createSubclass: &quot;MyClass&quot;</pre>
</ul>

<p>defines a <i>MyClass</i> message at your top level object that references
the default instance of the new class it creates for you. To make <i>MyClass</i>
a permanent part of the data base, you simply need to update the data base.
When you do, subject to your privileges and update mode, any new or modified
objects accessible from your top level object will be saved.</p>

<span><i>^tmp</i></span>

<p id="tmp">While Vision takes care to not save objects you do not have the right
to save, it will try to save all of the new and updated objects referenced
from your top level object. If it did not, the data base would be left in
an inconsistent and damaged state. </p>

<p>Sometimes, you do not want everything you create during your session
to be saved. For example, you may need to record an intermediate result
temporarily. Alternatively, you may need to remember an inherently transient
object like a connection to a process, server, or client. Unfortunately,
if you directly or indirectly reference any of these objects from <i>^global</i>,
they will be saved. For example, if you interactively execute:</p>

<ul>
<pre>!partialResult &lt;- ...  # Do something useful</pre>
</ul>

<p>the object referenced by <i>partialResult</i> will be saved when the
data base is updated.</p>

<p>One way to avoid saving an object like <i>partialResult</i> is to reference
it from an object that Vision is not going to save. Vision provides just
such an object. That object is returned by the <i>^tmp</i> magic word.</p>

<p>Instead of referencing your temporary result from a name defined at
<i>^global</i>, you can reference it instead from a name defined at <i>^tmp</i>.
You need to do a little more work to define a name at <i>^tmp</i> since
the local variable definition shorthand <b><i>!variable &lt;- ...</i></b>
is not applicable to <i>^tmp</i>. Two alternatives are:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
^tmp define: 'partialResult' toBe: ( ... ) # Do something useful inside
                                           # the parentheses
</pre>
</ul>

<p>and:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
^tmp defineFixedProperty: 'partialResult';
^tmp :partialResult &lt;- ... # Do something useful here
</pre>
</ul>

<p>As long as the object returned by <i>^tmp partialResult</i> is 
not referenced
from a permanent object like <i>^global</i> or an object referenced from
<i>^global</i>, it will not get saved when the data base is updated. Of course,
if you later evaluate an interactive expression like:</p>

<ul>
<pre>!xyz &lt;- ^tmp partialResult;</pre>
</ul>

<p>you have committed Vision to saving the object.</p>

<p>Internally, the <i>^tmp</i> object is constructed by adding a layer
to <i>^global</i>. In particular, </p>

<ul>
<pre>^tmp super == ^global</pre>
</ul>

<p>always returns <b>TRUE</b>. Because <i>^tmp</i> inherits the
messages and property values of <i>^global</i>, you can use <i>^tmp</i>
virtually any place you would use <i>^global</i>. For example:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
!x &lt;- 92;
x print;
^tmp x print;
^tmp :x &lt;- 17;
x print;
</pre>
</ul>

<p>will display:</p>

<pre>       92       92       17</pre>

<p>when run interactively.</p>

<p>
<hr width="100%" ></p>

<h3 id="dynamicContext">Dynamic Context</h2>

<p><i>Dynamic context</i> defines your perspective on the data base. Two
magic words provide the dynamic context for an expression -- <i><a href="#date">^date</a></i>
and <i><a href="#local">^local</a></i>. The <i>^date</i> magic
word provides an expression with a point in time from which it should view
the data base. 
It is changed by operations like 
<a href="clDate.htm#ts"><i>date evaluate: []. </i></a>
The
<i>^date</i> magic word is a special case of a more general concept. Any
part of an application can be written to behave in a perspective dependent
way. One of many examples is the specification of a target currency used
to manipulate and display monetary values. To implement a dynamic perspective,
an application needs to provide any expressions that depend on that perspective
with access to the values that define it. The <i>^local</i> magic word
returns the object that records those values. </p>

<p>Dynamic context and perspectives are used to give your data base dimensionality.
When you use a multi-dimensional data base, you need to specify where you
are in the multi-dimensional space of that data base. For example, when
you ask for a value like <i>sales</i> from an object representing <b>General
Motors</b> or <b>Honda</b>, not only do you need to specify the object
that should respond, you may also need to specify a date and a currency
as well. Because dimensions apply to everything in general and nothing
in particular, dynamic context gives you a way to specify your place without
cluttering every expression with information about that place, whether
it needs it or not. In effect, dynamic context provides a way to pass parameters
to an expression without requiring that they be passed explicitly to or
through every expression. This is more than just a convenience. New perspectives
can be added at any point as your data base evolves. Adding those perspectives
without the tools of dynamic context requires re-writing all of the code
between where you are as a user and where information about that perspective
is needed in the data base. That is not a reasonable thing to do.</p>

<span><i>^date</i></span>

<p id="date">Time is a dimension that slices through an entire data base. When you
build a data base using Vision, you model some part of the world. Included
in that model are descriptions of the various kinds of objects with which
you are working. The description of an object includes a description of
its properties. Fundamentally, that is where time comes into play. One
of the decisions you make when you define a property is whether that property
varies over time. For example, if you are defining an object of type <i>Person</i>,
some properties like blood type never change; others like income change
regularly. For example:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Entity createSubclass: &quot;Person&quot;;
Person
  defineFixedProperty: 'bloodType'.
  define: 'income';

!thatPersonOverThere &lt;- Person createInstance;
thatPersonOverThere do: [
   :bloodType &lt;- ^global Named BloodType OPositive;
   :income asOf: 92 put: 35000;
   :income asOf: 93 put: 45000;
   :income asOf: 94 put: 52000;
   :income asOf: 95 put: 47000;
];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>When you ask for the <i>income</i> of <i>thatPersonOverThere</i>, you
probably are not asking for the person's life history -- you want
to know what that person's <i>income</i> was as of a particular point in
time. If you ask for it interactively, Vision supplies the most recent
value available as of today (technically as of <i>^today</i>). For example,
assuming that you interactively asked Vision to evaluate:</p>

<ul>
<pre>thatPersonOverThere income</pre>
</ul>

<p>on August 15, 1996, you would get the answer:</p>

<ul>
<pre>47000</pre>
</ul>

<p>When Vision accessed the <i>income</i> time series, it got a date from
the <i>^date</i> magic word. In an interactive session, <i>^date</i> returns
the start date of the session.</p>

<p>You change the date used to access time-series properties with the <i>evaluate:</i>
message. For example:</p>

<ul>
<pre>92 evaluate: [ thatPersonOverThere income print ];</pre>
</ul>

<p>displays:</p>

<ul>
<pre>35000</pre>
</ul>

<p>The <i>evaluate:</i> message does not permanently change the value of
<i>^date</i> -- it only changes it while the block it was passed is running.
For example, when the expression:</p>

<ul>
<pre>

</ul>

<p>is run interactively on August 15, 1996, it displays:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
12/31/1992
8/15/1996
</pre>
</ul>

<p><i>^date</i> is the only context changed by the <i>evaluate:</i> message.
In particular, you have probably noted that the <i>^current</i> objects
constructed for the blocks in these examples understand the <i>thatPersonOverThere</i>
message.</p>

<p>The <i>evaluate:</i> message is also implemented for date ranges. For
example:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
91 to: 96 by: 1 yearEnds.
evaluate: [ ^date print: 12;
            thatPersonOverThere income printNL;
          ];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>displays:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
12/31/1991        NA
12/31/1992      35000
12/31/1993      45000
12/31/1994      52000
12/31/1995      47000
12/31/1996      47000
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Changing the value of <i>^date</i> always involves the use of a block
which is evaluated in the context of that new date. That is because the
<i>evaluate:</i> message does not modify a hidden global variable somewhere.
Instead, it pushes a new <i>^date</i> value onto a stack. When
it returns, it pops that stack. This allows you to nest <i>evaluate:</i>
messages and get the result you expect. For example:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
95 to: 96 by: 1 yearEnds.
evaluate: [ ^date year printNL;
            ^date to: ^date - 3 quarterEnds by: -1 quarterEnds.
            evaluate: [ &quot; &quot; print;
                        ^date printNL: 12 ;
            ];
          ];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>displays:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
     1995
 12/31/1995
 09/30/1995
 06/30/1995
 03/31/1995
     1996
 12/31/1996
 09/30/1996
 06/30/1996
 03/31/1996
</pre>
</ul>

<p>Any class can implement a message that rebinds <i>^date</i>. For example,
all of the messages that enumerate the elements of a <i>TimeSeries</i>
also make the effective date of the element available as the value of the
<i>^date</i> magic word when they are processing the element.</p>

<span><i>^local</i></span>

<p id="local">The <i>^date</i> magic word is a special case of a more general concept.
The <i>^local</i> magic word generalizes that concept. </p>

<p><i>^local</i> works according to the same principles as <i>^date</i>
-- it has a default initial value that can be overridden for the duration
of a block. Any part of an application that needs to return a perspective
dependent result can send messages to <i>^local</i> to determine what its
perspective should be. The default <i>^local</i> object should respond
to those messages with answers that select the default perspective. To
change to a different perspective, a <i>^local</i> override should redefine
those messages to return whatever new values are appropriate.</p>

<p>The framework supplied by Vision in support of <i>^local</i> is very
small. Basically, Vision supplies a default initial value for <i>^local</i>
and a single message that changes the <i>^local</i> object for the duration
of a block. By default, <i>^local</i> returns the same object as <i>^tmp</i>.
That means that an application can define its default perspective in terms
of properties defined persistently at <i>^global</i> or transiently at
<i>^tmp</i>. To override <i>^local</i>, all objects respond to the <i>asLocalContextFor:
aBlock</i> message. That message arranges for its recipient to serve as
the <i>^local</i> object while it is evaluating its block argument. Like
the <i>evaluate:</i> message defined at <i>Date</i>, the <i>asLocalContextFor:</i>
message pushes its object onto a stack of <i>^local</i> objects. When it
returns, it pops the stack. As a result, calls to <i>asLocalContextFor:</i>
can be nested without unexpected consequences and without causing a permanent
change to <i>^local</i>.</p>

<p>The preceeding discussion of <i>^local</i> has been very general. That
is because <i>^local</i> is a general concept that can be used to implement
multiple perspective dependent views of the data base simultaneously. One
such perspective dependent view is the target currency used to manipulate
and display monetary values.</p>

<p>To compare and aggregate monetary values, they must be expressed in
a common currency. There is, however, no single right choice for that currency.
It can be whatever is appropriate for the current user of the data base.
Like time, it is cumbersome and inappropriate to require that every operation
that returns a monetary value also accept an extra parameter to specify
its result currency. This calls for the use of <i>^local</i> and dynamic
perspectives.</p>

<p>To implement dynamic target currencies, <i>^local</i> must respond to
a message returning an object of type <i>Currency</i>. That message is
called <i>currency</i> and is defined by the top level object in object
space 3. Because the default <i>^local</i> object inherits from your top
level object and all top level objects inherit from object space 3's top
level object, that definition is available as the source of a default target
currency.</p>

<p>To override the default target currency, the <i>Currency</i> class defines
an <i>evaluate:</i> message similar to the <i>evaluate:</i> message defined
at <i>Date</i>:</p>

<ul>
<pre>
Currency
defineMethod:
[ | evaluate: aBlock |
   !currency &lt;- ^self;
   ^local
      extendBy: [ !currency &lt;- ^my currency ].
      asLocalContextFor: aBlock
];
</pre>
</ul>

<p>This method adds a new layer to the current <i>^local</i> object. That
layer overrides the <i>currency</i> property and is used as the new <i>^local</i>
object for whatever block the <i>evaluate:</i> message was asked to process.
Although the <i>evaluate:</i> message could have supplied any object as
the <i>^local</i> context for that block, it makes sense to base that object
on the current <i>^local</i> object. That is because <i>currency</i> may
not be the only dynamic perspective available. Since there may be others,
the <i>evaluate:</i> message at <i>Currency</i> needs to start with the
existing <i>^local</i> object so that it does not lose or damage the other
perspectives.</p>

<p>The selection of the <i>^local</i> properties used to define a perspective
along with the definition of an <i>evaluate:</i> message that overrides
those properties completes the first part of the process of defining a
new perspective. Using the perspective information available from <i>^local</i>
is the responsibility of methods attached to your classes. The following
code fragments show how it can be done:</p>

<ul>
<pre>Entity createSubclass: &quot;Company&quot;;

Company
define: 'rawSales'.

defineMethod:
[ | sales | rawSales * currencyFactor].

defineMethod:
[ | currencyFactor |
   ^self baseCurrency exchangeTo: ^self currency relativeTo: ^date
].

defineMethod:
[ | currency |
   ^local currency isntNA
      ifTrue: [^local currency] ifFalse: [^self baseCurrency]
];</pre>
</ul>

<p>Most of the work in these methods is bookkeeping. The part that is relevant
to dynamic contexts and <i>^local</i> is the implementation of the <i>currency</i>
method. Basically, this method asks <i>^local</i> for a currency to use
as a target.</p>

<p>The following illustrates how this capability works in a real data base.
This expression displays GM's sales in each of four currencies:<pre>
  Named Currency
  send: [DEM, GBP, USD, XAF].
  do: [
      ^self evaluate: [
          ^local currency name print: 30;   # (same as name in this case)
          ^global gm sales printNL
          ] ;
      ] ;
</pre>
This is what gets displayed:<pre>
  German Deutschmark            235869.64
  British Pound                  97265.30
  United States Dollar          152172.00
  Franc                         152172.00
