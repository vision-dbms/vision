title: "Vision Release  6.1.3 Notes"
---

<p>
<h2 id=pmadescription>PMA Release Description</h2><p>

<p>
This PMA Release includes miscellaneous bug fixes and enhancements that have been assembled since the previous release.  

<p>
Additionally, this release includes the creation of <b>Summary</b> and <b>Detail EstimateBridge</b> classes and protocol as well as enhances <b>EstimateFeed</b> processing  to support tracking individual estimates for multiple brokers for an entity/period/measure.  The class <b>VendorEntity</b> has been added to provide an organization for retaining external data about entities that have not been identified in a common class such as <b>Security</b> or <b>Company</b>.  The class <b>Matrix</b> and protocol have been added to manipulate matrix objects.
<p>


<b>Software Requirements</b>: These patches have been defined to work with batchvision release 6.1.3, but can be installed with any release starting with 6.1.1.

<p> 
<b>Installation:</b>
Three Vision scripts have been included with this release:
<p>
<ul type=disc><table cellspacing=4>
<tr align=left valign=top><td>patch.1.9core<td>contains messages that have been added to or modified in
the core classes
<tr align=left valign=top><td>patch.1.9estimates<td>creates <b>Summary</b> and <b>Detail EstimateBridge</b> subclasses and supporting protocol
<tr align=left valign=top><td>classMatrix.vis<td>defines the <b>Matrix</b> class and its protocol
</table></ul>

<p>
The script <i>cleanupDataRecords.S</i> is provided as a production-ready script
that can be used to delete instances in all DataRecord subclasses that have
been flagged for deletion but not yet removed from the database.  In future releases, this script will be included in the directory:
<pre>     /localvision/production/Updates/workArea/Cleanup/scripts</pre>
<p>
These scripts can be installed using VAdmin.  The script <i>classMatrix.vis</i>  can be installed into any Vision database, independent of this release.

<h2 id=patch19core>patch.1.9core</h2><p>
<p>
This script contains messages that have been added to or modified in
the core classes.  These changes are summarized below:
<ul type=disc>
<p><li>Modified the <i>asDateFromYearForMonth:andDay:</i> message at Integer
     to make sure that the supplied year (recipient) is non-negative,
     that the supplied month is between 1 and 12, and that the supplied
     day is between 1 and 31 before attempting the conversion.
<p>
<li>Modified the <i>asNumber</i> method at String to return a double precision
     value when the supplied string does not include a decimal point but
     is too large to convert to an integer.  Prior to this change the
     method would return NA when the recipient was a large number with
     no decimal point in the supplied string.
<p>
<li>Modified the methods <i>asHighResolutionTime</i> and <i>asLowResolutionTime</i>
     at the class <b>Utility UnixSeconds</b> to assume that the internal year
     count starts at 1900, not 0.  Prior to this fix, these methods were
     returning current dates in the year 100 instead of the year 2000.
     The methods <i>localTimeNow</i> and <i>gmTimeNow</i> at the class <b>Time</b> were
     similarly modified.
<p>
<li>Modified the <i>getMessageFor:</i> method at <b>Schema MessageDescriptor</b>
     to locate the correct version of a message implementation for
     messages that start with the _ character and are presented in all
     upper case characters.
<p>
<li>Modified the <i>run</i> method at <b>Interface ApplicationWS</b> to eliminate
     the possibility that someone running web applications could bypass
     security and use a listener to run unsuitable methods.
<p>
<li>Modified the data inspection reports in navigator to display
     a custom format for <b>EstimateBridge</b> instances.
<p>
<li>Modified the <i>updateNetworkIfSpaceIsLow</i> method at <b>AdminTools</b> to handle the degenerate situation where an update does not drop the total network allocation value below the threshold.
<p>
<li>Added the fixed property <i>lastModifiedByFeed</i> to <b>Object</b>.
<p>
<li>Added the class <b>VendorEntity</b> as a subclass of <b>Entity</b> to provide
     protocol to manage links to instances of a related entity class.
<p>
<li>Added the class <b>Matrix</b> and protocol to manipulate matrix objects.
<p>
<li>Added the method <i>extractValuesForDateRange:within:</i> to the <b>TimeSeries</b>
     class.  This method returns a time series for each date in the supplied
     date range.  The value of the time series on the date is returned
     if it is within the supplied offset, otherwise the default value is
     returned for the date.  The method <i>extractUniqueForDateRange:</i>
     uses the offset in the date range to determine if the point is
     within the correct duration.  This prevents returning the same value
     from the underlying time series for more than one date.  In other
     words, the <i>as of </i>logic which could return the same underlying record 
     for different dates, will return the default value instead of the <i>as of</i>
     value.  For example:

<pre>         !ts <- TimeSeries new ;
         ts asOf: 98 put: 98 ;
         ts asOf: 99 put: 99 ;
         !dr <- 98 to: 99 by: 1 monthEnds ;
    
         #--  this sample returns the value 98 for 12/98 to 11/99
         dr evaluate: [ ^date print: 15 ; ^my ts value printNL ]  ;
    
         #--  this sample returns the value 98 for 12/98 only
         ts extractUniqueForDateRange: dr . do: [ ^date print: 15 ; printNL ] ;</pre>
  <p>  
<li>Added the method <i>extractTSOf: block overDateRange: drange</i> to the
     <b>Collection</b> class to extract data using the block over a date range
     for a collection.  The method returns a time series of lists of
     the data element with the points corresponding to the dates in the
     date range.  The method <i>getTotals:</i> uses this method to compute
     the total for the list for each date.  Note that other variations such
     as <i>getAverages:</i> can be implemented as well.
<p>
<li>Added the method <i>redefineAsFixedProperty:withDefault:</i> at the class
     <b>Object</b> to convert an existing time series property to a fixed property.
     The value in the original time series as of the evaluation date is
     copied into the fixed property for each instance of the recipient
     class and any of its subclasses that inherit the property.
<p>
<li>Added the method <i>redefineAsTSProperty:withDefault:</i> at the class
     <b>Object</b> to convert an existing fixed property to a time series property.
     The default value is stored in the new time series property as of
     the earliest possible date.  The value in the original fixed property
     is stored in the new time series property as of the evaluation date.
<p>
<li>Added the method <i>removeDeletedRecords</i> to the <b>DataRecord</b> class
     to delete all instances in all stores that have been flagged for
     deletion.  This method is used in conjunction with the new cleanup
     script <i>cleanupDataRecords.S</i> described above.


</ul>
The script <b>patch1.9core</b> also contains the following changes to DataFeed and related classes:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Modified <i>setUpdateBlocks</i> at <b>DataFeed</b> class to fix interpretation of headers containing the text "date".  Prior to this fix, all
     fields starting with the characters "date" were interpreted as
     the date, leading to a random condition which caused the date assignment
     to be random.  This patch enforces that the date field used is the one
     explicitly named "date", "DATE", or any other upper/lower case combination.
<p>
<li>Modified the <i>naTest</i> option in the configuration file to accept
     a list of strings that represent the NA value.  The NAs should
     be separated by the ',' character. For example:
<pre>         naTest | NA, NM </pre>
<p>
<li>A new configuration file option, <i>naPatternTest</i> has been added
     which will convert data to NAs based on the existence of the
     pattern in the data.  The pattern can include the special pattern
     matching symbols supported as <i>regular expressions</i>.  For example:
<pre>         naPatternTest | 999, -999 </pre>
     converts any value containing the characters 999 or -999 to the
     NA value.  To restrict the list to values starting with 999, use:
<pre>         naPatternTest | ^999, -999 </pre>

<p>
<li>Modified the <i>displayExceptionSummary</i> report to allow subclasses to
     perform their own test on whether to include <i>isProcessed</i> in the
     <i>Other Status</i> section; modified <i>hasStatusInfo</i> at MasterFeed so that
     new creations would be counted even if they are not processed because
     they are duplicates.
<p>
<li>Modified the general <i>runUpdateStats</i> to set the timestamp of modification
     in the underlying object associated with each feed instance processed.
<p>
<li>Modified the <i>initializeDate</i> at <b>DataFeed</b> to support a new date
     format,  YYYYMMXX, which converts the supplied date in YYYYMMDD format
     to end-of-month format by dropping the DD and returning the last
     date in the year/month.  This provides a way to convert fields
     containing the last business day of the month into the last day of the month.
<p>
<li>Added a switch that allows you to update time series properties in an EntityExtenderFeed only if the value is a change.  This works with EntityExtenderFeeds that are used to update fields that are time series properties, not feeds that
     update time series of records.  You can set the switches
     <i>enableOnlyUpdateOnChange</i> and <i>disableOnlyUpdateOnChange</i>
     to control the behavior of the next update for the feed.
     This value is reset to <i>disableOnlyUpdateOnChange</i> after each update.
<p>
<li>Modified the <i>purgeEntityTSDataRecordsFor:</i> message at the
     EntityExtenderFeed class to automatically delete the records that
     are purged.  Prior to this, the records were detached from their active
     entities or bridges but left around for deletion at a future time.
<p>
<li>Modified the <i>isApplicationClass</i> method to include <b>ToolKit</b> as
     a valid class.
<p>
<li>Modified the <i>processAdjustments</i> method at PropertySetup to
     prefix adjustment method with <i>^self</i>.
<p>
<li>Modified <i>getUploadProperties</i> at AliasFeed to eliminate a <i>Selector Not Found</i> in the <i>describeFeed</i> display.
<p>
<li>Modified the GlobalsFeed initialization to ignore the record
     containing the header.  The fields are always assumed to be in
     the order <i>option</i>, <i>setting</i>, and optional <i>settingType</i>.
<p>
<li>Modified the method <i>createDataRecordClass:</i> defined at
     Interface ExternalFeedManager to only create a feed if the
     path to an entity is supplied.
<p>
<li>Added a configuration file option to set the currency for any records
     loaded in the feed that do not provide an explicit value.  The
     option <i>currency</i> can be set to a valid currency code (e.g., USD,
     CAD).  This is the equivalent of including the field <i>currencyId</i>
     and setting its value explicitly for each record.  Note that if
     this field is included, the configuration value will only be used when the
     value for a particular record is blank or NA.
<p>
<li>Added a switch that enables/disables the <i>new ones</i> report from
     displaying.  By default, the <i>new ones</i> report will display except
     for EntityExtenderFeeds where the default is to disable this report.
     This setting is permanent for the feed (i.e., you do not need to 
     enable/disable each time you run the feed) and can be changed
     using the <i>enableDisplayNewOnes</i> or <i>disableDisplayNewOnes</i> message.
  <p>   
<li>Added an option to specify a configuration file when loading a
     file directly with <b>DataFeed</b>. The new method at <b>DataFeed</b> is
     <i>loadFromFile: withConfig:</i>.
<p>
<li>Modified the <b>DataFeed</b> method <i>loadFromFile:</i> to return an update
     status indicating success or failure (TRUE or FALSE).  The value
     FALSE is returned if the specified file is missing or empty.
<p>
<li>Added rejection file generation to <i>loadFromFile:</i>, <i>bulkLoadFromFile:</i>,
     and <i>Interface BatchFeedManager upload:usingFile:withConfig:</i>.  Any
     rejected records are written to a file with the same name as the
     input file with the <i>.rejects</i> extension.  The first line of
     this file will be the field order list used to process the feed.
     Subsequent records will be the records that were not processed
     by the feed, followed by a rejection reason where possible.
<p>
<li>Added the configuration file option <i>rejectFileName</i> which 
     allows you to override the default reject file name (which adds
     the <i>.rejects</i> extension to the name of the file loaded).
<p>
<li>Added a configuration file option to <i>bulkLoadFromFile:</i>.  The
     new method defined at <b>DataFeed</b> is:
<pre>            bulkLoadFromFile: fname 
                  withConfig: cfgName
                andBatchSize: bsize 
                   fromBatch: bnum to: enum</pre> 
     where <i>fname</i> is the name of the file to load, <i>cfgName</i> is the
     name of a configuration file, <i>bsize</i> is the approximate size of
     a batch in characters, and <i>bnum</i> and <i>enum</i> are the beginning and
     ending batch numbers with 0 representing the first batch.  The
     configuration file is read in once and preserved for each batch
     processed. If the configuration file contains a <i>fieldOrderList</i>
     it applies to the entire file; otherwise, the line specified in
     the configuration file as the <i>headerLineNumber</i> is used to set
     the <i>fieldOrderList</i>.  If no line is specified, the first non-blank,
     non-comment line of the feed file is assumed to contain the field names.

     Several configuration file options are not meaningful after the header line
     is identified and are disabled in subsequent iterations, these are: 
        <i>skipTop</i>, <i>skipBottom</i>, <i>maxRecords</i>, and <i>asOfdateLineNumber</i>.
     All lines up to and including the <i>headerLineNumber</i> are skipped
     during the bulk load.
<p>
<li>An old bug that was occasionally losing blank characters has been fixed
     in this version of the bulk loader.
<p>
<li>Added a check for duplicates to MasterFeed loads; if duplicate
     underlying records exist, neither will process and they will be
     included in the exception report and reject file.
</ul>
<p> 
The following changes to investment layer messages have been included
in <b>patch.1.9core</b>:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Modified <i>setCusipTo:</i> and <i>setSedolTo:</i> at <b>Security</b> to detect if the cusip (sedol) matches the 8 or 9 (6 or 7) character code
     and if so, resets the code along with the cusip (sedol) change.
<p>
<li>Added the <i>_primaryCompany</i> property to <b>Company</b> which can be
     used to set a parent company when it is different from the
     company (e.g., GMH's primaryCompany is GM).  The method
     <i>primaryCompany</i> returns the <i>_primaryCompany</i> if it exits,
     the company itself otherwise.  This property can be updated
     using the CompanyMaster feed.
<p>
<li>Modified <i>createHoldingsFrom:</i> method at <b>Account</b> to eliminate the cash <i>roll up</i> step.  Prior to this patch, all securities
     flagged as type <i>cash equiv</i> were rolled into a single security
     to prevent the creation of many extraneous cash instruments.
     Since this rollup is now handled by the accounting feeds and/or
     a preprocessing step, the assumption is that all cash securities
     supplied by the feed should be created as individual cash holdings.
<p>
<li>Modified <i>addAlias:</i> and <i>deleteAlias:</i> for the <b>Account</b> class so
     that aliases added/deleted from specific subclass instances are
     maintained in both the subclass' naming dictionary (i.e., Named Portfolio)
     and in the <b>Account</b> naming dictionary (i.e., Named Account).
<p>
<li>Added the method <i>removeDeletedRecords</i> to the <b>PriceTools</b> class
     to delete all instances in all pricing stores that have been flagged 
     for deletion.  This method is used in conjunction with the new cleanup
     script <i>cleanupDataRecords.S</i> describe above.
</ul><p>
The script <b>patch1.9core</b> also contains the following changes to investment
layer <b>DataFeed</b> classes:
<p>
<ul type=disc><li>Modified SecurityMaster feed to only post a cusip or sedol change
     if it is not currently associated with a different security;
     this prevents accidentally moving IDs from one security (and its
     company) to another; to cause a change, first change the cusip or
     sedol in the security that currently <i>owns</i> the id.
<p>
<li>Added options to SecurityMaster to enable/disable posting cusip,
     sedol, and or company changes; update exception report to display
     changes made (if enabled) or skipped (if disabled).
     The messages <i>enableCusipChanges</i>, <i>disableCusipChanges</i>, 
     <i>enableSedolChanges</i>, <i>disableSedolChanges</i>, <i>enableCompanyChanges</i>, 
     and <i>disableCompanyChanges</i> can be used to enable/disable these
     options.  All three  options are reset to enable after each run.
<p>
<li>Modified SplitsFeed to use <i>locateId:</i> instead of <i>Named Security</i>
     to lookup supplied <i>entityId</i>.
<p>
<li>Modified PriceFeed to use <i>locateId:</i> instead of <i>Named Security</i>
     to lookup supplied <i>entityId</i>.
<p>
<li>Modified PriceFeed to remove all purged records as part of the
     purging process.
<p>
<li>Modified PriceFeed to process the items <i>open</i>, <i>bid</i>, and <i>ask</i> if present in the feed header.
<p>
<li>Modified HoldingsFeed <i>runWrapup</i> to more efficiently update the
     aggregate accounts.
<p>
<li>Modified <i>rejectReason</i> in SplitsFeed to flag if a bad date is supplied.

<p><li>Modified <i>rejectReason</i> in PriceFeed to flag if a bad date is supplied.

<p><li>Modified <i>rejectReason</i> in HoldingsFeed to flag if a bad account, security, or date is supplied.
</ul>
<p>
<h2 id=patch19estimates>patch.1.9estimates</h2><p>
<p>
This script creates <b>Summary</b> and <b>Detail EstimateBridge</b> subclasses and
supporting protocol and contains the method modifications needed to 
support these new subclasses.  The following changes are included
in this script:
<p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Modified <b>EstimateBridge</b> subclass creation to initialize the
     <i>observation</i> and <i>actualRecord</i> with the parent class' default.
<p>
<li>Modified <i>actualRecord</i> to be a time series property at <b>EstimateBridge</b>.
     Note that this redefinition will move values at existing instances
     from the fixed property to the time series.  This update needs to
     be reviewed for individual classes.
<p>
<li>The method <i>setActualFlagTo:</i> at <b>EstimateRecord</b> has been modified
     to track the actual records over time.  Only changed values are
     added to the time series.
<p>
<li>The methods <i>actual</i> and <i>actualDate</i> at <b>EstimateBridge</b> have been
     modified to return the last actual observation.
<p>
<li>Reorganized the <i>_estimate</i> and <i>estimate</i> definitions for 
     <b>EstimateRecord</b> and its subclasses and redefined <i>currencyFactor</i>
     to use the <i>baseCurrency</i> of its underlying <i>baseEntity</i> when its
     own <i>baseCurrency</i> is the default.
<p>
<li>Modified the <i>priorPeriod</i> and <i>nextPeriod</i> methods at <b>EstimateBridge</b>
     to correctly work with subclasses.
<p>
<li>Modified the <b>EstimateRecordFeed</b> to process the actuals in the
     correct order.
<p>
<li>Modified <b>EstimateRecordFeed</b> to support detail level and static
     <i>periodEndDate</i> updates.  
<p>
<li>Added the switch, <i>enableActualFlag</i> which can be set prior
     to processing an <b>EstimateRecordFeed</b> to indicate that all records
     in the feed should be flagged as actuals.
<p>
<li>Added a method to create an <b>EstimateBridge</b> summary class and associated
     detail bridge class and feed to Interface ExternalFeedManager:

<h2 id=batchvisiondescription>Batchvision Release Description</h2><p>
Batchvision Release 6.1.3 is a minor upgrade, providing some enhancements and fixes to recently discovered bugs, which are described below.
<p>
<hr>
<h2 id=signal>Signal Handling on NT</h2><p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Some signals which in prior versions would cause a batchvision
     process to exit are now caught and reported as a <i>read-eval-print</i>
     error (becoming more like the signal handling on the various unix
     platforms).
<p>
<li><i>Control-C</i> can now be used to interrupt a vision execution without
     causing the batchvision process to exit.
</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id=dbupdate>Miscellaneous Fixes to DBupdate Tools</h2><p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>The inability to correctly handle layout files with large
     field descriptions has been fixed.
<p>
<li>Under AIX, empty input files can now be incorporated, 
     as is possible on our other supported platforms.
<p>
<li>Additional information is provided for some error messages.

</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id=tuning>Update Default Values for Tuning Parameters</h2><p>
<ul type=disc>

<pre>   Parameter			Old Default	New Default
   ---------			-----------	-----------

   LargeTaskSize		50,000		500,000
   VisionAddressThreshold	0		0x80000000 (solaris only)
   VisionMaxSegSize		0x7fffffff	0x2000000</pre>

</ul>
<hr>
<h2 id=enhancement>Minor Enhancements to <i>batchvision</i></h2><p>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Referential alignments to unmodified reference uvectors are now deferred
     when possible. This can sometimes result in substantial reductions in the
     heap size of a batchvision process. Also optimized the case where all the
     changes to the referenced range are beyond the end of the current range.
<p>
<li>A maximum number of serious errors allowed in a session has been established.
     The first serious error beyond that maximum results in the session exiting.
     The default maximum is 25, but this value can be modified in two ways:  the environment variable <i>VisionMaxSeriousErrors</i> can be set, or the <i>Utility</i>
     <i>SessionAttribute</i> feature can be used.  For example:

<pre>	   Utility SessionAttribute
	   define: 'visionMaxSeriousErrors'
	     toBe: (271 asPointerTo: Utility SessionAttribute).</pre>

     would install <i>VisionMaxSeriousErrors</i> as a settable
     <i>SessionAttribute</i>.  The parameter can then be modified via the
     following:

<pre>	   Utility SessionAttribute visionMaxSeriousErrors <- 0;</pre>

     This would result in the session exiting at the next serious error.
<p>
<li><i>substituteOutputOf:</i>, <i>appendOutputOf:</i>, <i>filterOutputOf:</i> now return errno
     if an error was encountered in an interface with the file system. In previous
     versions, errno left-shifted by 16 bits was returned.

<h2 id=bugfixes>Miscellaneous Bug Fixes in <i>batchvision</i></h2><p>
<ul type=disc>

<li>LIO buffer usage is now included in memory allocation statistics.
<p>
<li>The Vision compiler now explicitly reports an 
     error when the size of a block's string space is exceeded.
     This is a rare occurence, which previously resulted in undefined behavior;
     usually a <i>Selector Not Found</i> error.
<p>
<li>Primitives implementing <i>substituteOutputOf:</i> and <i>appendOutputOf:</i> 
     are now more efficient regarding memory usage when run in scalar mode.
<p>
<li>Under HPUX, <i>0 log</i> now returns NA, making it consistent with behavior
     on other platforms. Previously it returned the largest negative double.
<p>
<li>An error printing the largest negative double value is fixed.
<p>
<li>Some read-eval-print error messages modified to provide more detail.
<p>
<li>String comparisons now work with extended strings.
<p>
<li>Ability to print doubles with exactly 10 digits to the right of the decimal
     point has been added.
<p>
<li>Improved memory usage on non HP platforms by applying an HP 
     specific error recovery technique only to the HP version. Similarly
     removed recovery mechanisms only beneficial to Solaris and NT from
     the HP and AIX versions.
<p>
<li>The NDF rebuilder, running under the <i>fromOSD</i> mode, now ignores any
     numeric file names outside the range of possible spaces (1-1023) when
     encountered in the supplied object space directory.
<p>
<li>The NDF rebuilder, running under <i>fromNDF</i> mode, will insert the supplied
     object space directory into the <i>NDF.new</i> file which it creates. 
<p>
<li>Segments recognized as not matching the transaction id recorded in the 
     NDF are now unmapped immediately to prevent their being accessed again
     later in the session when no check for validity is done.
<p>
<li>Under NT, a limit is now in effect on the amount of data that is written
     to the console in a single operation. The limit is 32 kilobytes. If that
     limit is not enforced, then the process will hang.
<p>
<li>User defined handlers for OpenVision channels are now cleared from the
     channel upon close. Prior to this version, a handler would persist
     across open/close cycles of the channel until explicitly reset.
<p>
<li>Arguments to the numeric value comparison primitives are now checked to
      that they are indeed numeric; an error is reported if they are not.
<p>
<li>The primitive implementing <i>whileTrue:</i> now leaves a FALSE result for all
     data threads when run inside a list operation.
<p>
<li>Fixed a memory leak occurring when an interrupt (control-C) is signaled
     in a session.
<p>
<li>Fixed AlignStore/CleanStore primitive for IndexedList/TimeSeries.
<p>
<li>Introduced sanity check to catch erroneous configurations of an
     incorporator string store.
<p>
<li>A rarely encountered bug in <i>LIO_reset</i> is fixed. A segmentation fault 
     occured if a <i>malloc error</i> happened during the allocation of an LIO buffer.
<p>
<li>The primitive found at <i>AdminTools ObjectSpace totalSpaceAllocation</i> no
     longer causes container table allocation in a previously unaccessed space.
