<h3> Vision Is Mission-Critical in Largest Investment Firms</h3>

Vision, from Insyte, is the cornerstone of mission-critical portfolio management 
and analysis systems at some of the largest and most prestigious investment 
management firms in the industry, including:

<p>


These investment firms have been using Vision to keep their portfolio management 
systems on the cutting-edge -- a significant accomplishment given the 
unprecedented market activity and rapid technological change of recent years.

<p>

<p>
<h3>Now You Can Have Vision Up and Running Quickly</h3>

Vision, the same ahead-of-the-art technology the largest investment firms use, 
can be up and running in your firm in a matter of weeks.  Why?  Because 
breakneck changes in technology have created previously unimagined opportunities 
for bringing one of the most sophisticated portfolio management and analysis 
systems on the market today to more investment firms and more investment 
professionals.

<p>

Technological advances have been dramatic over the past decade.  Operating 
systems have been revamped, and new ones introduced, to take advantage of ever-
more-powerful hardware.  The internet, merely a curiosity a few years ago, has 
become central to global  -- and corporate -- connectivity.  Easy-to-use web 
browsers have made the internet and corporate intranets accessible to everyone.

<p>

Vision has advanced, too, staying ahead of and exploiting all of these 
technological innovations.   Now Vision offers an extensive set of intranet-
based portfolio applications and easy startup procedures.  As a result, more 
investment firms can use Vision to improve their portfolio management and 
analysis systems, and more investment professionals within these firms can use 
Vision to make better business decisions.
<p>


<h3>Integrated data.  Sophisticated analysis.  Easy access.</h3> 

<p>
Vision's power lies in its ability to bring together internal and external 
information, analyze it, present the results in clear, easy-to-understand 
applications, and deliver those applications directly to the investment 
professionals who need them.
<p>
Vision seamlessly integrates any number of internal and external data sources 
(domestic or international), including:
<p>

<ul align="left" type=disc>
<li>Portfolio holdings -- all asset and security types
<li>Fundamental company data
<li>Pricing feeds
<li>Currency data
<li>Earnings estimates
</ul>

<p>

Vision comes with an extensive set of sophisticated, yet easy-to-use, investment 
management and analysis applications designed to meet the needs of such 
functional areas as:

<p>

<ul align="left" type=disc>

<li>Portfolio management
<li>Research
<li>Compliance
<li>Marketing
<li>Performance
</ul>
<p>

Vision's applications are delivered directly to your users' desktops through 
their familiar intranet browser.  What's more, you can tailor the applications, 
and add new ones, as your firm's business requirements dictate.

<p>

<h3>A System Designed to Meet <I>Your Needs</I></h3>

<p>

Vision provides an infinitely flexible, extendible environment.  As a result, 
your Vision portfolio management and analysis system can be customized easily to 
meet the needs of your firm and your investment professionals.  

<p>

At the beginning, you may decide to implement Vision quickly and use the 
standard set of applications that come with the product.  Over time, you may 
decide to modify the applications, add new applications, or add new data 
sources.  Eventually, you may decide to exploit Vision's full range of 
capabilities as both a powerful database management engine and an object-
oriented programming language.

<P>
Vision allows you to design a system that can meet your needs today and adapt to 
your changing needs tomorrow.

<p>

<h3>Implementing Vision is Easy</h3>

Insyte's technical consultants will work closely with you to ensure a smooth 
system implementation.  With our clear installation notes and personal technical 
assistance, installing the Vision software is easy.  In addition, with our well-
defined <a href="pmaInstall.htm">startup procedures</a>, getting your system to production may take only a 
matter of weeks:

<p>
<I>Weeks 1 through 4.</I>  The goal in the first four weeks is to define and 
load your internal data so that portfolio managers can view their own portfolios 
via their desktop browsers.
<p>
<I>Weeks 5 through 9.</I>  The goal during the second four weeks is to link your 
system to external data feeds, modify Vision's standard applications to meet 
your needs, and develop custom reports.  At the end of this period, you will 
have a complete, functional system with all the data feeds and applications you 
require for rollout.
<p>
<I>Weeks 10 through 14.</I>  The goal during this period is to put the data 
upload process and other necessary operational procedures into routine 
production, enabling you to smoothly manage the day-to-day administration of 
your Vision portfolio management and analysis system.
