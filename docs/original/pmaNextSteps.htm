<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>
If you used the methodology outlined in 
<a href="pmaInstall.htm#methodology"><i>The Portfolio Management
Application Installation</i> document</a>, your Vision database
now includes an integrated set of internal and external
data feeds, procedures to update this data on a regular basis,
and a number of useful applications delivered to users via an
internal intranet.
You are now ready to begin enhancing
your Vision environment by adding new applications and data
feeds and further automating the production cycle.
<p>
The remainder of this document provides useful links to other
documentation that will help you learn and expand your Vision
environment.

<h3 id="language">Vision Language Access</h3>
<p>
Before you can use the Vision language, your Vision server and user code
may need to be configured.  If you have problems starting
and executing the supplied examples, you should ask your Vision
Administrator to <a href="admSysAdmin.htm">check your configuration</a>.
<p>
The following documents are designed to familiarize you with various aspects
of the Vision language:

<h3 id="production">Production Management Tools</h3>
<p>
<p>
Many Vision installations are designed to receive various data feeds on a 
regular basis.  Once the data is saved in the Vision database, other
updates that rely on this data can be performed.  In addition,
standard production reports can be generated based on the completion
of one or more updates.
<p>
There are a number of ways that you can automate your daily
production cycle.  A comprehensive set of scripts have been 
provided for Unix environments as a template for this automation.
These scripts can be used directly or can serve as a basis for
designing your own production process.
<p>
The production process is described in detail in the document
<a href="admProduction.htm"><i>Vision Administration: Production
Processing</i></a>.

<p>
<hr>
<h3 id="feeds">Advanced DataFeed Capabilities</h3>
<p>
Once you have loaded all your initial data and set up basic
procedures for automating your updates, you may want to explore
some of the more advanced data feed formats which can be used
to define new classes, update properties, and establish relationships.
These feeds are described in the document
 <a href="clDataFeed.htm#schema"><i>Vision Class: DataFeed</i></a>.
