<h3><a name="overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>
The core Vision system comes with a set of classes already defined.
These classes include an initial set of methods which can be
modified and extended by the user.  Vision's built-in class
hierarchy is discussed in detail in the general Vision reference manuals.
Insyte offers an Application Layer that presents a set of useful classes
and protocol designed to support investment management applications.
The Investment Management
classes and messages were entirely implemented using the Vision
language.  You can therefore modify, extend, and reorganize the
structures to meet the specific needs of your organization.
<p>
Note that the instances created for the core investment classes
will be dependent on your installation's requirements.  Many of the
named instances used in the examples in these document
are included for illustration
purposes only and may not exist in your environment.
You can create them using the techniques provided or substitute
instance identifiers that are defined for you organization.

<h3><a name="company">The Company Class</a></h3>
<p>
The instances of the class <b>Company</b> represent the individual 
corporate entities for which you track information.  Information
maintained for a company typically includes sales, earnings
estimates, and ratings.  A large amount of raw data about companies
is provided by external data vendors.  In Vision, this data is viewed
as a property of the company.  
<p>
The document, 
<a href="invSecurity.htm"><i>The Company and Security Classes</i></a>, 
describes this class in more details.
<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="security">The Security Class</a></h3>
<p>
The instances of the class <b>Security</b> represent the individual 
securities issues by a corporation, government, or other entity.
A variety of security types exist including common and preferred
stock, convertible and non-convertible bonds, and options.  Data 
maintained for a security typically includes price, dividend, and
shares outstanding information.  Portfolios hold specific amounts of
one or more individual securities.  Raw data about securities
is often provided by external data vendors.
In Vision, this data is viewed as a property of the security.  
<p>
The document, 
<a href="invSecurity.htm"><i>The Company and Security Classes</i></a>, 
describes this class in more details.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="account">The Account Class</a></h3>
<p>
The class <b>Account</b> is a super class of the classes
<b>Portfolio</b>, <b>AggAccount</b>, and <b>IndexAccount</b>.
A Portfolio is defined as an account whose holdings are created via a feed
from an internal portfolio accounting system.  An AggAccount is
defined as an account whose holdings are created by combining the holdings 
for a list of component portfolios.  An IndexAccount is defined as an
account whose holdings are created starting with a universe of securities.
<p>
The document, <a href="invAccount.htm"><i>The Account Class</i></a>, 
describes this class in more details.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="holding">The Holding Class</a></h3>
<p>
The class <b>Holding</b> is used to represent a specific holding by an
account in a specific security as of a specific point in time.  
Holdings are rarely referenced directly.  Instead they are accessed
via a particular security or account.  Data maintained for a holding
typically includes shares held and total market value.
<p>
The document, <a href="invHolding.htm"><i>The Holding Class</i></a>, 
describes this class in more details.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="issues">Special Issues</a></h3>
<p>
Special structures have been designed to manage dividend,
price, and adjustment data in the Vision database.
These structures have been created to correctly handle split and
currency adjustments
automatically.  In addition, these structures have been designed
to facilitate future reorganizations as the database grows, so that 
applications that use this data are sheltered from structural changes.
<p>
The document, <a href="invIssues.htm"><i>Special Issues</i></a>
describes these issues in more detail.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="datasets">External Data Sets</a></h3>
<p>
The Investment Management Application Layer provides access to a
variety of data sources that are updated by an external vendor on
a regular basis.  These data sets are linked to specific companies,
securities, or other instances as part of an update process known
as reconciliation.  The reconcile addresses any adjustments that are local to
a specific vendor so that access to multiple data sources can 
appear as homogeneous as possible.  Cusip changes, splits adjustments,
and fiscal year management are all addressed in a uniform manner.
<p>
The document, <a href="invExtDB.htm"><i>External Data Sets</i></a>
describes this process in more detail.
